1,t3_dip94b,I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. ",depression

3,t3_dizljq,[Recipe] Depressed Grilled Cheese Sandwich,"For this recipe, you'll need a few ingredients.

1. The willpower to get out of bed.

2. Two slices of bread. Make sure and thaw the bread out first, since you only go grocery shopping every 2-4 weeks and stockpile things in your freezer.

3. Two slices of cheese.

4. Toaster that you've had since 1996

Take one slice of bread and place a slice of cheese on it. Fold it in half and smush it real flat. Do this with the other slice of bread and cheese. Place each half-sandwich in its own slot in the toaster and set the toaster to a medium golden brown usual setting.

Grats, you now have enough nutrition to last you half a day or so, or longer if you can manage to just go back to sleep and sleep for a long time. Remember, you're not lazy, you're just conserving your energy and resources, which is good for the environment.

If anyone has any recommendations for improvement to this recipe, just keep it to yourself. Simplicity is our best friend.",depression

I'm selfish too, there's plenty out there suffering way more than me and here I am bitching about my first world problems.

16,t3_dixchq,I'm learning how to love life.,"I met with a new therapist today and he taught me something amazing that I thought I'd share with all of you.

I know it sounds cliche - but you really have to take time to stop and smell the roses. Take time to experience what is around you as well as the thoughts and feelings inside. And remember that what happens is what happens. Bad experiences are a part of being alive and being human, eventually you will look back and you will appreciate it.

Start small. Look around you and experience what life is offering you right now. Find something, anything, that makes you feel happy or at least content. Right now I'm looking out my dorm window at the city I live in. And I'm taking the time to appreciate what a beautiful city it is. It's full of people who are all living lives of their own. Our paths may cross, they may not. And who knows if my life is better or worse for it. And who cares. I'm living my own life and having my own experiences, and that's a good thing.

Whatever happens is just what happens. You cannot change the past and you cannot change the future, and that's okay. Just keep living your life. That's really all that you can do.",depression

I was really athletic all the way up until high school. Then depression got the best of me. (My eczema is insanely bad and looks like a bucket of acid was thrown on my whole body). I used to have a bunch of great friends in middle school. But now they sort of moved on and stopped talking to me. I have no friends now. I’m in grade 11 and it’s really hard to fit in. When u have no where to sit because u have no friends is really embarrassing. I go home and isolate myself everyday. I wear long sleeves all the time to hide my cuts. It’s really hard at school. I don’t  even care about marks anymore. I sit in the bathroom for lunch. I don’t speak to anyone at school. Except one girl who talks to me via snapchat. The only reason is because she feels sympathetic towards me. I wake up everyday either in a good or bad mood. I walk to school, late as always, and I get through the day and get home. I either play video games or lay in bed for the rest of the day. Weekends suck. I have no one to do anything with so I am constantly by myself. I’m thinking about suicide all the time.

25,t3_diq1jv,Please never start self harming.,"Self harm is having permanent scars for a temporary problem. 

I used to cut my arms and legs, I have permanent reminders of my pain and grief, and my impulsive behavior. I feel shame when I look at them. My arm is the worst, I cut too deep one night out of rage and had a very scary moment of regret. My arm bled everywhere. All over me, my bed, it took me a while to stop the bleeding. I needed stitches. I never went to the hospital because I was afraid of how my parents would react. Now my arm has unsightly raised, white scars that will be with me for life. People will sometimes ask about them, and I often will make up a story for how I got them. 

You don’t want to be like me. You don’t want to feel the shame, the guilt, of carrying self harm scars around. If you’re thinking about hurting yourself, please, please don’t do it. Find a distraction. It’s so addicting, and you will find more ways to hurt yourself. I would burn myself with my cigarettes when I was breaking down. I would punch walls till I was bruised on my hands. I broke my knuckle doing this and it’s not been right since. Still hurts at times. Just don’t even start.",depression

I've been trying to make something at least work! I want something to work. I spent all of last year trying to finally love myself, and I was doing pretty okay with that. Everything seemed like it was going to be okay for once in my fucking life! 

It was a short-lived optimism that resulted in my mental health and self-esteem collapsing. 

I'm failing my classes because I'm just out of it, I'm terrified/unmotivated to work on my college apps because I lack the confidence that I can actually go into one, my family life is essentially being a manipulated pawn between my mom and dad, and my best friend, who I love and just want to be happy with, rejected me... I even lashed out on her and she blocked me due to my stupidity. I can't seem to feel truly happy right now. Nothing's turning out okay. No matter how hard I try, nothing goes the way I want it to. Trying to fight against it all just makes me a more bitter person. 

I want to be okay. I want to love myself. I don't want to harm myself again. ~~I threw away my belts and anything sharp~~. I just want to know how to function. I've been on autopilot since God knows when. I can barely speak or do anything I enjoy doing anymore! I don't have a sense of self-perservation. I'm not gonna end it. Personally, I'm too lazy for that shit... but I don't like living this life. 

I feel isolated. Like the world loves to laugh at me try to be happy. Every attempt at wanting a better life ends up with my face on the floor again. I just want to stand up and try to be okay with myself.

I don't really know how to describe this too well, but i'll try. Sort of more recently, i've felt depressingly dull, empty, and worthless on the inside. I've developed horrible anxiety from being in school and feeling as if no one cares about me. My self esteem has plummetted to a horrible low, and I really can't think about a single ""good"" thing about myself. I honestly remember a single good thing anyone's said about or to me at any point recently. Though I feel this way, to try to fit in I never really show any emotion to anyone. When engaged in conversations, I just try to make s**ty jokes in effort to not stand out horribly as weird or introverted. In my internalization of all of this, i've gotten myself to the point where I don't really feel much actual emotion anymore. I have horrible trouble expressing my emotions, even when I am in the solitude of my own room. I've tried to let it out and cry to myself and actually can't. I feel like I can't really talk to anyone about it without seeming dumb or miniscule, and no one knows because I never show it. Does anyone else ever feel this way? If it helps, I am a male as well.

60,t3_dj0mns,What is it that's happening to me?,"Hello reddit, 

I don't know what I'm going through but this feels like the right kind of place to talk about it.  I'm a 19 year old male attending a respected state school, I just recently celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my girlfriend (more on that in a bit), and I have a small social circle of people I know care about me.  Yet despite all of this I feel almost constantly that my life is this gray haze.  I've almost lost all motivation to do anything (as we speak I have a months worth of foreign  language HW that's a day over due and I've barley started it).  I feel that the things I use to enjoy are utterly draining and so I tend to just avoid doing them.  I feel myself not wanting to leave my dorm room at all and a part of me is afraid to hang out with my friends because I don't want to seem like a bummer or have them try and pick my mental health apart.  I've found myself reverting to old bad habits (filling time with constant porn watching, not brushing my teeth, doing laundry at the last minute, either not eating enough in one day or gorging on junk food, staying up till 3 or 4 in the morning to name a few).  and of course I'm also lying to everyone in my life about all of these habits or feelings at some level because I feel I cant be honest with anyone. 

In regards the girlfriend, we both attend different colleges that are not easy to travel to and from so for our anniversary went and flew down to her college and spent a long weekend there.  Those three days I was able to spend with her were the only time in the last month or more I wasn't faking smiling and felt a lasting sense of joy.  But now that I'm back at school I've felt myself only dig my self an early grave with self sabotaging and deceit.  We call and text regularly but there is lots of time where I'm basically alone and that's where I find this horrible gray wash over me.  

I'm considering taking next term off but I haven't been able to talk to my parents (who are both have PhD's and basically worked and payed both of their ways through college and graduate school) about it because I would be their second child who had to leave college due to emotional issues and they still treat her as if she's failing them even though she just got promoted at her job and is making 80K a year.

75,t3_dj2kte,I’m just worthless.,"Hello, to maintain anonymity I’ll just say my name is Greg. and I am in my first year of university (just letting you know for time and age reference) Before I begin, I’m not trying to seem like my life is terrible because I know for a fact I’m blessed for having the things I have and I’m very grateful for the people who are in my life. I’m not aiming to seek pity I just truly need to let these things off my chest because it’s eating me up on the inside and I just cry as I’m not able to express to anyone my true feelings. I don’t know if this is the right place to say all this but I genuinely don’t know what else to do because I have no one to talk to simply because I’m living my life as lie. The people all around me view me as this individual who is great in every aspect of his life (school, social life, gym, work), but that’s all a facade. You see, since the beginning of high school I was surrounded by individuals who worked hard and were high-achievers. This was all new to me because in middle school I never really focused on my education, but for some reason this facade of me being smart came aboard and I’m not sure why. I was always the nice kid who everyone could get along with because I prioritize the relationships in my life and I put other people before myself. Regardless, in high school I was put under pressure (by no one in particular just myself) to achieve as greatly as my best friends did. The problem was I was extremely lazy (never did homework and the problem is my school was self-paced meaning you can hand in work whenever as long as you follow the 2 units a week rule) and would often neglect doing my school work simply because I don’t have the discipline and work ethic to do so. I probably would still be in high-school right now if I didn’t have teachers that neglected the 2 units a week rule (there are 18 units in a semester and I would had in approximately 12 units in the last 2 weeks of school). All throughout high school I felt this pressure to maintain the image other people had of me (being smart) so I would lie about my grades constantly (say I have a 96 in a class when in reality I had a low 80 or high 70, more on this later) which would just maintain that facade. But, in grade 10 my friends found out I was lying and I was attacked verbally for being a liar (they remained my friends and even after that they still thought I was smart).  As the years progressed, the lying continued but I just got better at it and my lack of work ethic got so bad that I would finish a lot of classes with a straight 50 (gr 11 functions I got a 56 and gr 12 calculus, physics, chemistry and advanced functions I got a 50). My friends and the people around me all believed me when I told them the fake grades because of how well spoken and kind I was, they thought I would never lie to them. I even lied about where I would be going to university and then eventually covered it up by saying “lost my offer” even though I never had an offer in the first place. That’s just one aspect of why I felt the need to admit to all this.. another thing is my family. My mother and father got divorced when I was in gr 9 and I handled it well. I’m good at understanding other people’s point of views and I understood it was best for both of them to separate. They were never married so they verbally agreed to a certain type of child support (250$ every two weeks to help my brother and I). Regardless, my family is of low income (my mother makes approximately 20k a year) and my mother works extra hard to try and maintain us especially now that both my brother and I attend university (fun fact I almost didn’t end up going to uni because I was too lazy to fill out my course schedule). The gist is my family is poor and because I don’t have a job or any form of financial security, I steal money from my mom to fund the shit I do. She doesn’t know and neither does anyone else, but it just goes to show how much of a shitty person I am. It’s like I have two voices in my head, one that knows what’s right and one that knows what’s wrong and I keep feeding the one that strays towards the wrong doing side. I used to be an athletic, all-around good kid but now here I am 220 lbs at a height of 5’9 with no job, a lack of work ethic, ambition, and I have the audacity to steal money from the only person who’s ever truly been there for me and loves me. I don’t think I’m depressed because I know shit could be worse, but I just feel like I’m the worst person in the world and that nobody truly knows me and if they did everyone would fucking despise me and I try so hard to change but I can’t even manage to do because of how worthless of a human being I am. Everyone looks at me as the first kid in my entire family line that will go to university and graduate but I don’t even think I’m worthy or that I deserve that because of how shit of a human being I am. I’m a good person to others and I treat everyone good but I genuinely despise myself and sometimes I wish things could be different or that I just didn’t exist. There’s so much to say that I left out because I simply can’t organize all my thoughts into a coherent and understandable paragraph. But the gist is I’m a lying, lazy, unmotivated, stealing, fat, stupid and shit person who just wishes could be different..  to whoever read this all the way through I’m thankful that you listened even though I don’t deserve it. I hope you all have wonderful and amazing lives and may nothing but good fortune come your way. I’m truly thankful you read this and I guess that’s it for me.

78,t3_diypq9,Fighting depression or escaping from it?,"I've accepted recently that I'm depressed. It took me a long time. A healthy mix of burnout, anxieties, and hidden depression recently lead me to leave my job/studies (PhD student) halfway through; I just couldn't do it anymore.

I'm 27 and went back to leave with my parents. ""I'm just taking a semester off cause I'm a bit tired, but I'm fiiiiine don't worry"" \[note: I don't even know if I'll be able to go back to the university...\]. I didn't go into any details or explained that I'm definitively not fine by any means. I'm their kid who had a successful education and ended up accepted in a top American university with prestigious scholarships and whatnot, and who also never talked much anyway. This would be very hard for me to approach, I actually don't know how to talk to them about that.

I've realized too late that I could have used some help. A few weeks before leaving, I called my university for medical center to get a  mental health appointment: this took me a lot of effort already, but I didn't have the courage to show up... Now I moved back to my home country. I don't want my family to know I'm seeking this kind of help and it would be hard to find something good anyway where I live. I'm only staying for a short time anyway. I've mentioned how I feel to a single friend, maybe the only person who have asked me ""Are you OK?"" and to whom I was eventually able to answer ""No"", ever. This friend has been of great help, actually made me realize and accept depression, gently pushed me to seek medical help (or tried to...), listened to me ; also shared their own experience with their own depression. But I don't want to consider them as a therapist, we've talked a bit ""in depth"" about my issues but I feel like it would be very unfair for me to just use our discussions as therapy sessions. And anyway I'm far from them now and it is not the kind of discussion I want to have by messages, emails or phone.  
In short: I feel like I have no one to talk to.

I'm about to travel, do some woofing (working in a farm in exchange of food and a place to sleep, with a day or two off every week). I feel like being in another environment (new country and even continent, but not too exotic either as I will be able to communicate easily), having a routine, manual work outside, being around people, etc..  could be beneficial. Seeing the sun sometimes too (I don't remember seeing a blue sky where my parents leave). I take it as vacations but with a frame, a frame needed to help me not stay alone for weeks in my bed in the dark doing nothing, crying and sleeping. I'm afraid I would do that if I were to travel alone and stay by myself in hotels. And it's cheap too.

I'm kind of excited about it. It had been a while... Everything is set up and I'm leaving in a few days. But I'm also worried. Let's say I enjoy my experience there and don't feel like crap every day. Is it actually fighting depression, or whatever I'm struggling with? Or is it just putting it on the side, running away from it, hiding it and pretending it doesn't exist? Just for it to come back stronger than ever as soon as this experience ends and I'm back to my usual way of living and working? How do you know if what you do is helpful long term?",depression

I show my love by doing things like cooking and cleaning whereas when I'm not touching him he gets upset and lately its been so hard to be affectionate. Its just something else I don't have energy for after working all day and then cooking and then cleaning and I've been trying to explain that he's asking too much of me right now but he just does not understand and I hate him for it.

89,t3_dj2alo,Random rant post,"I:

- Fixed my grades


- Got a job


- Have nice savings 

- Fixed my home life



I seem on track for a good life but I'm still so fucking miserable. I remember for the longest thought that if I just fixed my shit, I'd be better. That's bs. I don't think I've actually felt more miserable before, because I have no clear desire or will in life anymore, I'm just a giant ball of depression that nobody gives two fucks about outside my close family. 





Everyday is also just a giant struggle. Everyday, absolutely 0 exception. I dread waking up, I dread going about my day, I dread everything. I just wanna leave, go somewhere, but not be here doing what I do. I have to be up for classes in 4 hours and holy shit I hate it.



I hate how I fit the personality of just some sad awkward loser. I hate it so fucking much. I just constantly think of myself as less than the average person just because I know I'm just the stereotypical loser and I hate myself so much for it. 






This is also probably the most legitimately pathetic thing ever, and I cringe as I write this down, but god I just want a hug. Not just a casual one from my mom, but just like an actual, nice hug. I  literally haven't been hugged in years and god does it feel pathetically lonely. 




I've noticed a lot of depressed people say they feel this depressive narcissism where they hate themselves but also think of themselves as superior, and honestly I don't get that. I just, could never think of myself as being better than someone. I just fucking suck, that's all there is to it. And as I write this shit down I'm just reflecting on myself and how much of a fuck I am and why I'm such a loser.





Sorry I know this is a lot of self cynicism but it's just a rant post, I need this. This is how I feel.

My dad has depression and anxiety and he's bipolar. He always seems to compare me to him when I bring it up. He says if I was depressed he'd know it. I'm embarrassed to ask for a therapist and we couldn't afford it anyway. I made online friends and it went away but it's back. Before I met them I was really close to suicide. I hate myself for many irrelevant reasons and feeling suicidal and self hateful makes me hate myself more. I don't know where to go next. I feel like life isn't worth living. The only thing that distracts me from suicidal thoughts is video games and memes and lately (for the past year) I don't have much motivation for it. It feels like a chore to do anything. It got better before so I keep telling myself it'll get better again but then I wonder if getting better is worth it if I'm just going to be depressed again after.

I got to work and not even 3 hours later of a 12 hour shift I was ready to go home. I told my coworkers I had to go grab something out of my car and went to my car and had a mini panic attack. I felt so lazy.. I didn't even want to walk to my car but I knew I couldn't be in my environment for another second. I kept telling myself there is absolutely nothing wrong and to just get through the night.. then intrusive thoughts would come through with the most absurd lies (excuses) I could think of with reasons I absolutely needed to leave work. I finally got back to the floor 10mins later and was unsure if I wanted to stick it out. I finally got the energy to text my boyfriend back, who is very caring and supportive of my mental health and he came to visit me at 2am for 5mins or so. A few hours later I didn't even realize a few hours had passed. I started to feel so much better and before I knew it the shift was over. 

Moral of the story: don't give up on yourself because you can do things you don't think you're capable of. 

I was SO ready to leave. I felt uncomfortable and claustrophobic and overwhelmed and every other emotion in between.. but if you tell yourself to just get through one more hour over and over finally it just flys by and you don't even realize it.

103,t3_dj0g79,One Year,"Hey, I'm new to this subreddit and I kind of just wanted a place to write this all out since it's not something I can talk to my family about. It's been just over a year since I started treatment for my mental illnesses.

Last year I was finally out of my parents house and felt like I had space to breathe. The only catch was I had just started university and that came with a lot of added stress. After having progressively worse mental breakdowns for month and spending almost a year addicted to sleeping pills, I just broke down. My roommate was out of town so I finally hit rockbottom and let myself go. 

That weekend I spent  all of my time in my shitty dorm, laying on the floor, wishing more than anything that I'd had the balls to off myself back in middle school. I wanted all of the shit to be over. I sat crying for hours on end thinking about how I could get out with the least amount of damage possible. I downed more pills hoping to at least sleep so I could stop thinking, or at least stop crying. The pills didn't do shit. I don't think I left my room that entire weekend, but it was a blur. I don't remember most of what I did. I think I relapsed into self harm, I don't know if I ate or showered. That was the lowest I'd been in a long time and the breakdown was a long time coming. 

At some point I think I got in contact with my brother, I don't know if it was a call or text but he knew at least in part what was happening. I think my then girlfriend video called me at some point, but what we talked about, what she knew, I don't remember much of it other than just seeing her and breaking down again. I think that night was when I finally scheduled an appointment to get on medication.

How the hell I managed to make the appointment or drag myself to it, the fuck if I know. I had been to this health center with a different doctor who diagnosed my depression and anxiety, I had tried therapy but that made everything so much worse. So I tried again with a clean slate. A new doctor and being open to the idea of medication this time.

This new doctor had read through my file and I didn't have to rehash the abuse, the trauma, the anxiety. She was wonderful and I can't be grateful enough for how wonderful she was. With in like an hour I finally had a plan to move forward, I was on a treatment plan, I was finally diagnosed and, felt like I could ""get my joy back"" as she had said. 

I still had anxiety about my parents finding out about me seeking help, but after a long conversation with my brother I finally had the balls to call my dad and tell him what I had done. Fuck it still hurts to think about that phone call and how his voice cracked and how I know he cried after we hung up and how we both knew he couldn't talk to his wife about it after all she'd done to cause this. I still hate that it had to hurt so much. But I know we're all better off this way.

It's been a hell of year getting my shit back together. I used to think I knew what it meant to work on yourself and become a better person but I know I didn't have a damn clue. I still have addictions and they keep trying to drag me back but every day not caving gets easier. I'm able to sleep and eat on a regular schedule. I don't lash out like I used to. I'm single and learning to be independent and grow as my own person. I'm learning to ask for help and to put myself first for once in my damn life. Shit after 9 months of working my ass off I woke up happy one day and the moment I realized what was happening was nothing short of a fucking miracle. It had been years since I felt that kind of relief and happiness and now I cherish every morning I wake up and I can just breath. After a year I can finally meet new people and make meaningful connections, I'm finally making real friends in college.

I feel like I can be my dad's daughter again, like I can be my little brother's big sister he needs and deserves. I have a relationship with my other brother again, one strong enough I was able to come out to him recently (I had to be drunk but fuck I did it and its been such a relief). My life is totally different today than it was a year ago and I couldn't be more grateful. I'm not going to act like my life is perfect. I still have my bad days. My PTSD, depression, and anxiety aren't gone, but I'm learning to live again and holy shit its been so worth it. 

This is pretty condensed, but its already longer than most people will read so I'll leave it at that. I'm so grateful for people who pushed me to get help and I'm so glad I decided to not end it. I'm going to keep going, and keep working because god damn it I'm getting my joy back.",depression

107,t3_dj1p8y,"Did my (28M) actions kill the relationship, or did her (22F) chronic depression -or both?","Hi Everyone, sorry this is a read. Posted this earlier in the r/relationship_advice, too. 

So the past month has been a series of ups and downs, with my girlfriend fully cutting ties (in a confusing way), 5 days ago. Here's a recap of our relationship and how things went down:

\-We began dating 8 months ago. During such time we've spent a lot of time together, sometimes seeing each other for at least a little bit every day for months. We never grew tired of seeing each other, and always were coming up with things to do or things to talk about naturally. As she put it, ""Everything just felt real"". We shared an incredible bond, chemistry, and similar views on a range of topics. We traveled multiple times, both by road trip and flying to somewhere. We both would tell each other we were our sole mates and that we wanted to someday get married many years down the road.

\- Very quickly in the relationship, I learned she had a very difficult past. She was sexually molested and abused as a child by her mother. She stuffers from PTSD to this day because of it.

\-Because of her past drama, it has lead her to the wrong people growing up, looking for affection. She would sleep with up to 3 different people a week in her late teens, and would see people who would use her for rough sex into her early 20's

\- She also did a few highly immoral things...things that when she told me, I almost ended it for. But I didn't out of respecting it happened in the past and treating her as the person I knew in the relationship I had with her.

\- In our time together we went though a few things as well...two months ago, her friend committed suicide, which triggered her depression to return. This also lead to a ER visit, where I literally carried her in. During this time after her friends passing, the relationship took an unbalanced turn towards me giving more than she was, but I was patient with her and understood what she was going though...I was just happy to be there and helping her in any way I could.

A month ago today, our relationship was at our peak. We had just came back from a trip, and we were on cloud nine or being there, supporting and cheering for us. The next day however, as I let her borrow my laptop, she found something immoral I had done in my past before dating her, on my desk top. I did it in a very dark time of my life a year ago, when I was lonely, anxious, and was grieving the loss of a previous relationship. I had been heavily intoxicated and stoned while I did it, so much to the point I didn't even remember the event much later down the road.

She confronted me about this after I worked a 16 hour day. I meet her at a restaurant just past midnight, where she asked me for the truth and what it was about. I told her mostly the truth, but she caught me in a lie, which obviously didn't help. When asked later why I lied, I was scared, tired, and caught off guard about being confronted in public so openly.

After a few days of a break, she ended it with me, saying ""I'm so deeply in love with you, but I can't be with you."" But we proceeded to hang out all night, driving around, sharing a beer at a favorite bar, and her holding my hand. In the days following that, she continued to text me, we would meet a couple times, and it would lead to sex.

After taking a trip out of town for a few days to clear my head and do some self reflection, I asked to talk to her. I admitted to my mistakes while in the relationship, talk about things I could do to fix our current issues, but that what happened in the past before her I was greatly ashamed of and regretted, happened in the past and was not the person I was with her in this relationship. I left that night from her place, still broken up and her not giving me a single chance to try to make things right.

The next day I returned her things to her, and told her I would respect her decision. Upon this we ended up talking for 5 hours, where she decided to give our relationship a chance and work though the bump with had about my past. This lead to two weeks of us dating, seeing each other nearly every day, and working things out. There was still something between us, but we were honestly working things out, and I myself was making an effort to improve the things I promised to improve.

This all ended last week when I came over to her place after another long day at work. She had already been drinking, and I could tell she was tipsy/upset. I didn't want her to keep drinking alone, so I accepted her invite for a glass, also drinking hers a little to keep off how much she was drinking, as I was concerned of her state. I hadn't eaten a lot that day and got drunk pretty quickly.

After an hour or so of visiting, she told me she wanted to head to bed and I felt the impression she wanted me to leave. I wasn't in a state to, so I suggested staying for a bit before I could...but it still hurt she wasn't even looking out for my well being, nor the fact I had came to see her, drank and then felt just used for a short period of time. I began to put on my shoes and this began a fight.

I said some hurtful things during the fight. A ""fuck you"" and ""You're so selfish. All you care about is yourself and your tiny little world."" She ended it during the fight, saying she couldn't do this anymore and that she didn't care anymore.

After we cooled down, I asked her what caused her to drink tonight alone, and she told me her Mom, who hadn't contacted her in almost a decade, reached out a couple days before. I sat with her, listened to her, and talked though some options with her on how to go forward...I love her and I wanted to be there for her in the moment no matter what was going on between us.

We spent the entire day together, talking about our relationship and what we were going to miss. Apologizing for the drunken things I said and being forgiven...yet she didn't want to get back together. She asked if I'd be mad if she reached out to get back together at some point, and even suggested talking around Thanksgiving.

Yet she kept me around her apartment all day, crying, kissing me, and eventually lead to sex a couple of times.

In the last 10 min of our night (it was night by now), she kept grabbing my face with both hands, kissing me passionately, and telling me, ""I love you so much...SO SO much."" As I finally left, she texted me ""I miss you already."" ""I love you so much"" --- We've not spoken since.

I know our relationship was in a rocky place before the fight, and that didn't do anything to help it. But I'm just trying to understand fully what happened. I'm beginning to feel her depression, which lead to stress and anxiety in both of us, --mixed with her trying to overcome her friend's suicide, and her abusive mother trying to reconnect--- Lead her to the inability to handle the additional stress our relationship had developed into. That she ended it because she can only work on so many things, and has decided she can't work on herself and us at the same time.

So I guess, my question is...was it her depression that lead us to breaking up, the fight, or a mixture of both? And can I win her back someday?",depression
108,t3_diy7ab,Making friends is exhausting in your 20's and I think i'm just done with people in general.,"So by surprise as usual when i give up on everything a new opportunity prevents it'self.

Although I’m not currently in a low point of my depression, my overall anxiety/adhd/depression combination absolutely wipes me out, and it drives me absolutely mad when my parents make me out to be a lazy bum when they KNOW what I go through. 

Like I got myself through childhood trauma, got myself through college with good grades while working 2 jobs even though I was either sick or injured half the time, and although it’s not a paying position, I got myself a part time job at a well known lab doing my own research while I figure out my next step (either grad school or corporate job). And you know what? I’m TIRED. I’ve worked so hard my whole life and battled my whole life. I don’t go around asking for a gold medal, but god forbid I want to use a week or two where I don’t have any obligations other than therapy to catch up on sleep for my own health and suddenly I’m a lazy bum who sleeps all day. 

For all of you who spend a lot of your time sleeping because sometimes that’s all you can do to say alive, know that you’re not lazy or worthless. Don’t be hard on yourself for giving your brain the break it needs. Are therapy and exercise important? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely get yourself up and get help when you can. But sometimes, you just need to sleep, and that’s ok too. You’re not a bad person because you don’t function the way other people do.",depression

116,t3_dj2zrf,Just Venting/Rant if anyone feel similar and wants to talk feel free to write me,"Man I wish we had universal healthcare. It sucks I was on psychiatric medication for 3-4 years until I turned 27 and was kicked off my parent's insurance.  
I had to stop cold turkey since my Dr didnt accept medi cal and apparently if a Dr knows you have medi cal they legally cant even let you just pay cash.  
 I searched everywhere, tried recommendations from my old doctor, called everyone in my town and couldn't find a single psychiatrist that would take Medi-Cal. Now I'm just fucked without the psych meds I need just to function like a normal human being.  
Aside from that without contacts my vision is so bad it's considered legally blind its 20/250 and I can't get more contacts without my old insurance. So once I ran out in a couple weeks  I have to figure out some way to get glasses.  

 I really wish we had a government with universal Health Care.  
Those countries with free healthcare actually help their citizens.  
The government and generation before us own all the land which is why I believe in Universal basic income. Give everybody a chance at a home and food and then you can work after that to purchance things you actually want.  

 I actually like working. I would much rather go out to work then sit and do nothing all day.  
 It's just hard to find a job especially with no car. Just a one-bedroom apartment around here is like 1300 a month  which it's pretty much impossible to afford especially on minimum wage, and this isn't even a popular city,

It's so tough sometimes, I know I should be way farther in life than I am. I owe people money and I feel like scum.  I just feel so horrible. 
  I know I could and need to be doing way better.  There's so much I want to do in life it's just so hard to get started.  

 Sorry just wanted to vent/rant. I figured it might be cathartic at the least. I'm staying positive. Life is short so I decided I'm not going to let myself get depressed. Fake it till you make it, including happiness.

It’s just that recently school started and I guess I’ve been preoccupied and missed a couple doses and I guess that led to me missing even more doses to the point where I’ve nearly stopped taking them altogether.

125,t3_dj2vb2,"I tried and failed helping myself by channeling the pain into doing what I used to love, and made a short film about my depression","I've been a long time lurker on this reddit, but after a long and hard fight that I lost I wish to share a story with this community.
The past few years have been rough, confusing, a mental routine hard to handle. For a long time I optioned for living in denial, felt bad for feeling bad, didn't have resources for any kind of help. 4 months ago I started to go to weekly therapy sessions, though nothing much has changed. It's been very hard for me to speak to anyone about what I'm expierencing, but I feel a suffocating need to do so. One thing I've always liked is watching horror movies, writing reviews and making my own zero budget short films, it's the only thing I try to push myself to do as hard as I can. Almost two years ago I decided I'm going to try and turn a project into something that might help me cleanse myself, but it turned out for the worse. I want to try and tell You the story of a short film called ""Mentalesque"", and not only that, with as much transparency as I can. It was the end of 2015 / start of 2016 when I was biting through the last months of high school &amp; it was also the time when things in and around me started to get more complicated, unpredictable, more suffocating. In the summer after high school I failed to get a scholarship at the potentially best choice of higher education for a want-to-be-filmmaker here in Latvia, so I had no choice but to enter a much lower level school which turned out to be awful. Two of my friends joined me. So started the toughest time of my life yet. In the first semester we made our first zero budget short film, which I have now removed from public surface. In little under three years, with the help of friends and relatives, we made five short films &amp; a lot of other videos, songs and other smaller things, all of which was outside of school stuff. School stuff (tasks and such) sucked and was useless for the most part, offering nothing short of frustration and disappointment. A lot happened during these years - movie making, movie watching, togetherness, loneliness, laughs, conflicts, tears, substance frenzy, maddening financial difficulties and just a lot of shritte, as we often like to say. All the while that happened, I started to experience difficulties more and more unfamiliar to me, developed bad mental habits, inability to feel calm, happy or content with the things I’ve made, or the things I do or even say, I lost my nerve a lot, eventually started to distance from most people, having trouble communicating or even going out in the public. Lots of relationships got ruined in the process. Simple things had become unnaturally hard or scary. For a long time I did nothing, optioned for denial, felt bad for feeling bad, didn’t really have the resources for any sort of help either. When the bad state of everything had become an etched-in-stone routine, I pushed myself and wrote an essay/script on how it all felt – that was the beginning for this short film, “Mentalesque”. Sadly, what was meant to be some sort of cleansing of inner demons turned out for worse &amp; drove me into a creative crisis and I didn’t write, film or make anything for a long time. In the spring of 2019 two friends and I wrote and shot a short film which resulted in an unexpected mental breakdown for me. Skipping the details, I finally started to go to weekly visits at the therapist. I’m now doing it for 4 months, and it’s been and still is a rather confusing experience. Things are still pretty much the same, some days worse, some days a bit better. My current routine, the circumstances I’m in now are tiring, regressive in certain ways, often sad, but I remain somewhat hopeful. I think so.
Mentalesque footage was shot in 4 or 5 days, with as much as 5 months in between shoots. The last of those days took place in this year’s May. I finally started slowly editing it 2 months back, and, well, it's now done. I've been unemployed and living with my parents for a few months now, I'm trying to get back on my feet, but I feel stuck and miserable. The reason why I told this story is because I feel like I need to share this film with the community, and it would mean a lot to me if someone here would find the film to be spiritually relatable.

139,t3_dj0anr,It's so sad seeing depression everywhere on Reddit.,"I've been browsing Reddit quite a bit lately, looking at subreddits (particularly meme subreddits) and I've come to notice what may be obvious to many people by now: depression is everywhere on Reddit. I've been on Reddit for years, and stuff about depression has always been there, but not like now. Depression is everywhere on Reddit, and it seems like everyone has depression.

I see it in meme subreddits, in wholesome meme subreddits, even in news subreddits. There's been [the almost meteoric rise of](https://subredditstats.com/r/2meirl4meirl) /r/2meirl4meirl, [of](https://subredditstats.com/r/lonely) /r/lonely, and [this subreddit](https://subredditstats.com/r/depression). For the most part, these subreddits started increasing in subscribers in June of 2017 and many have spiked in the last few months.

Because of this, it feels like depression has taken over Reddit. It's difficult to go anywhere without seeing someone who's struggling with depression, or self-confidence issues, or someone who believes that they're not worthy of affection even when other users try to convince them otherwise. I don't know what's causing it. I don't know if Redditors are just being more open about it, or if it's new users coming to Reddit (and those mentioned subreddits) to try and get support and find those who feel similarly. It's probably the latter. Who knows though.

This rise of depression on Reddit has had it's effects on me personally. In some ways, it's made Reddit less enjoyable, with it being hard to escape stuff about depression and find wholesome stuff uninterrupted. However, it does have it's positives. It's made me realize that I need help, and that I'm absolutely not alone. It's also helped illustrate just how bad the mental health crisis is getting but it's also helped show me how people are being more open in supportive. In many ways it's essentially a double-sided coin.

I want to die. Please let me know how I can do it painlessly. Don't give me bullshit words of hope and encouragement.

Nietzsche once said ''Man will find a way to live, as long as he has a reason to keep living for"" 

What do you do when you no longer have a reason? 

I have tried everything. And I've failed at everything. I have one card left to play. And I have to play it. 

Give me a painless way out now.

So I had depression since the age of 15 and dealt with sexual abuse and eating disorders so my situation until the age of 22 was never that easy. But just two years ago, I  had plenty of friends, had a boyfriend, had a job as well as my uni, was 30 pounds lighter, I had my problems yes but still had the will to get out of bed and actually do things. 

Now I quit my job, at the last year of my uni but I have never attended classes since the term started a month ago, I do some freelance artist work whenever they come my way but procrastinate the shit out of them. Basically haven't left my house in a month and I never contacted any of my friends and didn't replied to any texts etc. I have been on a couple dates but naturally they have been ghosted this month and I don't have the will to contact anyone and leave my house. 

Even the most basic task feels like I am going on a hike on the himalayas and I hate it. Whenever I get the courage to go outside I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and immediately give up because I gained a lot of weight in a short time and I the image of me in my head and in reality don't match and I feel ashamed.

160,t3_dj1y5g,"Don't You, Forget About Me!","TL:DR Got stood up by both my psychologist and my bff in a 2 hour period and getting stood up is a major catalyst for my depression and anxiety. 

Last month I started seeing a psychologist for the first time in 20 years of dealing with depression. She was great, I felt relaxed and really comfortable talking to her. Then my insurance got involved.

I've been off work because of my depression, since June. I am collecting long-term disability and they will be paying for my psychologist once my coverage is maxed out. As such, they have guidelines for the type of care they expect me to get. Specific mental health questionnaires, specific types of reports etc. My psychologist doesn't work that way, so she referred me to someone who does. Today was our first meeting.

I arrived at 11:55 for a 12:15 appointment, around the time I thought he was 10 minutes late, I got a notification that the appointment was at 12:35. My bad. Around 12:45 I was having the beginning of an anxiety attack, so I took an Ativan.

Here's the thing, one of the things I really struggle with is when people bail on me. Forgetting plans, cancelling at the last minute without a good reason, refusing to make plans until the last minute. It all makes me feel like I'm the backup plan or unimportant. I get really bad anxiety when it happens and it massively hurts my feelings.

So here I am, in the hall outside the office, crying because my fucking psychologist has forgotten about me. I tried calling, no answer. It's now 1:15 and I'm still sitting there, wondering if I got the time wrong, even though I'm staring at the email that clearly shows Wednesday 12:30. I've managed to get a grip and stop crying when my previous psychologist comes to get her client, I can see behind her that the other guy isn't in the office. She looks pretty confused and starts to ask me something, but I cut her off, and say ""I was supposed to meet him at 12:35 but I guess he forgot about me"" naturally my voice cracked and I started to leak again. She tells me that he's out of town and must have made a mistake and I should email him. I'm just trying to hold it together as her patient is giving me that look that screams ""you poor girl"" I'm just walking away like ""yup, will do thanks"" in the most obvious 'trying not to cry' voice ever.

My eyes leak the whole walk to my car, but I managed to get inside before completely losing my shit. I pull myself together and head to my friends house, we have plans and she's my emotional support buddy, so I know she'll help me calm down. I get to her house, and she's not there. She forgot about our plans. Now I'm sobbing again. I leave the tea I bought her on her kitchen table and go home to feel sorry for myself.

Based on a later conversation with my friend, she had 100% forgotten, so I didn't say anything about it to her. She has a lot of stuff going on with her too, and it's had a really bad impact on her memory. Telling her wouldn't undo the way I felt in the moment and would have made her feel guilty and horrible, then I would feel bad for making her feel bad ha

Now, nearly 30, I can see how it has hampered my life and held me back.

Unlike acute depression, mine doesn't have a specific cause. It never ceases and I don't have the outward symptoms others associate with typical depression. I can go to work, exercise and overall take care of my needs for the most part. However I've never had a decent paying job, despite finishing university and never moved out from my parents home. The negative thinking is something I have never been able to overcome.

164,t3_diwn3t,I hate how stupid I have become.,"I hate how looking back over my school and college years, I could have done WAY better if I had just looked for help and took some time off to get my shit together. The whole time was like a fog, and I was procrastinating till I was doing my homework 1am to 3am. which probably contributed to my depression and made me so stupid and lethergic during the day. It was fucking embarrassing being called out to answer a question and not being able to answer it because I spent the whole class too tired to listen and in my own little world.

I hate how I cannot adult. Basic things like insurance, bills, tax, driving, trying to remember the difference between credit and debit card, knowing how the water/well system runs around a household, doing maintenance etc. I am either too stupid to learn or not motivated enough to learn any of it. Some of this stuff was never taught to us in school because it was the ""parent's job"" and parent never taught this to us because it was the ""school's job"" and I might have missed the memo that we were supposed to self-teach these things ourselves I think.

I hate the fact that I have no curiosity for anything anymore. As above, I have always been told what to do and have a ""need to know for a good reason"" mindset. What I mean by that is if I have no reason yet to know about finances or car driving theory and etc, or apply skills like maths, IT, history and etc, then why would I need to worry about any of that then? But there is nothing worse when you are asked a question, or expected to use your skills in a situation, and you have realized that at your age you should have this basic knowledge regardless or that you let your skills go completely rusty so now you look like an idiot.

I hate how I have the goddamn Internet and library at my disposal, where I can search and study all the shit I need to know to my heart's content and self-educate myself, and I cannot even push myself to do that. My head feels foggy, I just want to sleep and when I read something, I just want to get to the end so fast. I can never remember anything first time around, and have to keep going over it again and again, and it makes me feel so useless. (Small example) I have a bike and a FitBit for more than a year, but I still haven't brought myself to learn about the bike anatomy or learn how to use my FitBit properly and I get caught out when I don't know anything about these two easy items I have had for over a year now.

I hate how a lot of this shit isn't even hard and is actually quite interesting, I just don't have the motivation or the push to stick with anything. If I could get away with it, I would just stay in my bed all day for the rest of my life. I cannot string a decent conversation together and tend to replace words in my speech (I think it is called paraphasia) and barely look people in the eyes properly. My facial expressions are so monotone, I actually look like a slow person.

I am hoping to get an assessment soon and look into getting medication, because I honestly have exhausted all my options. I don't expect to become a genius, but I want to try to cure the fog and get back the focus and motivation I need for life.

170,t3_dj1tj8,Me being stupid and probably wrong.,"I feel like I'm not loved in the ways I love others. I don't even mean romantic love specifically, but all forms of positive emotional connections that I would call love.

I'll start with the easy one, romance. I don't fall in love easily, and I can only really even start to have any feeling resembling romantic love with someone I can actually see myself living with for the rest of my life. My feelings don't pass a simple crush without feeling a very intense connection and a feeling of extreme close friendship. This all combines to me falling hard when I fall for someone. It's so fucking crushing then when people just fall out of love with me. Especially over things that are out of my control. I cannot understand how such small things can lead to people falling out of love.

Friendship is next easiest because it's similar. I make friends much more easily than I fall in love, but I'm ultimately just as committed and loyal. A friend of mine has to do something to truly destroy my trust or faith in them for me to choose to stop talking to them. The friends I do have I would do anything for, I'd risk jail time just to make them happier.  So when people just cut me out of their lives for without explaining a reason, or when their reason is along the lines of ""I guess I'm just not that interested in talking to you anymore"" it is so god damn painful, because it makes me feel like I've really hurt them, just by being me.

Family is a hard one to talk about but I'll try. I would commit murder on a massive scale to protect my younger brother, and I would everything I've ever had, everything I could ever have, and myself on the line to protect my parents. I care more than I could ever dream to describe for them. They are practically the last reason I'm alive. But often times they treat me like I'm an inconvenience, or an expense they'd rather not deal with, or a burden. I desperately want to be better for them, so they'll love me more, but I don't think that I can be better for them. I think the problem is just me. And I hate how that feels.

Like I said in the title it's all stupid and probably wrong, I don't know, quite frankly it doesn't matter. Even if it truly was wrong, and it could be scientifically and imperically proven, I wouldn't believe it to be wrong. I think I'll always have these distortions that magnify my own problems and downplay my privileges.

when summer started, everything took a downfall. i relapsed into my ed and self harm, and i became incredibly suicidal. fast forward to when school starts, i went inpatient for a week. 

so here’s where i am now: struggling. so much. i currently only having a 2 day clean streak, and every single second of the day i want to relapse into everything and kill myself. i feel like i’m slowly losing my friends due to my mental health (not that they don’t care about me, they do, it’s just getting to the point where i feel like they can’t handle me anymore). my therapist, who i actually liked, is switching me to a different therapist because i need “full-time care.” i’m doing an outpatient program for self harm, and i’m going back to my ed clinic to talk to therapists again and possibly do the outpatient program there as well (once the self harm one ends). 

i feel like a failure. holy fucking shit. my parents, especially my mom, have told me that they feel like they can’t help me anymore because i “never try to get better” which is complete bullshit! i have tried to get better and have used so many skills. i HAVE made efforts to get better. i’m continuously trying. but, them telling me they feel like they can’t help me, having to get switched to a different therapist, going to an outpatient group, possibly going inpatient AGAIN and the overwhelming thought that all my friends are leaving me out of fear makes me feel horrible.

this was really messy and probably didn’t make any sense, but i just really needed to get this off my chest. my anxiety has been horrible as well, and i don’t know if it’s from the meds i’m on or just the fact that i push everything down until i explode. i feel like i’m close to relapsing again, or developing new behaviors and i’m hopeless. i want to relapse so badly. i want to die. but deep down i know that this will supposedly help. i don’t know. i’ve been getting help since i was 10 or 11 and i’m just done with it at this point",depression

188,t3_diyyop,Why do I feel nothing?,"A bit of context

All my life I’ve failed at pretty much anything I’ve ever wanted to do. I just didn’t get it. After being assessed in second grade I was considered gifted, and had an iq of 134. At my school the gifted program cut off was the 99th percentile, so I didn’t make it (being one point off). I pretty much went through school slacking off and not caring what anyone thought. I used to have so many friends but after moving recently, I had no one. 

Pretty much, my parents got a divorce and I moved cities to live with my dad. Because of this I was exposed to a harsh reality. I realized that I couldn’t form connections with anyone anymore. From then on I felt like a total idiot, my marks were garbage, I had no social connections, my parents were always disappointed, I had no interests, basically, my depression began.

This year was the first year of my life where I had all my shit together. I made friends, started working out, got a gf, got above 90% in everything (even English which I am horrendous at), socialized, went to parties, formed a band, etc. My parents genuinely seemed proud of my for the first time. 

So then why do I feel nothing? Literally no happiness or sadness, just a slight feeling of dread. Has anyone experienced similar? Will this ever get any better? I feel like there’s a hole in my heart that can’t be filled.",depression

I was with him for 5 great years. But then an accident took him away from me. He fell while bicycling and was knocked unconscious. For a couple of months, he was dealing ok with the headaches, the mind fog, the insomnia and the dizziness. It got better then it got worse. It got better again but then he stopped handling it. He told me that life sucked, that it wasn't worth it. I tried my best to listen and tell him I loved him. He snapped at me so easily. Then he had a good spot where everything was ok. Then another bad spot. Then he broke up with me. He said it was too hard to talk to me about what was going on because I didn't understand what he was going through.

I don't want to abandon him if he's just trying to push me away but still wants me, loves me and needs me.

He refuses to see me so all I have is frickin groupme. I message him telling him that I love him and want to listen and help him, he reads my messages but tells me he doesn't want to speak to me ever again. then changes his mind. then changes it again. He leaves me on read now. All I tell him is that I love him and won't abandon him. I guess he hasn't blocked me or told me to fuck off so that's a good sign?

A week ago he held me and told me he loved me. I keep replaying a video of him from 3 weeks ago celebrating our anniversary. What the hell happened? What do I do? Should I give up? He's hurting me so much but I love him.

I would never tell my therapist that I’m embarrassed that I have to go to my appointments with her even though I am. No one else I know goes to therapy and it’s because they don’t need it. I try to keep going to therapy low key. I believe that a lot of therapy is just having them repeat what you just said and getting told I’m doing a good job and that I should be proud of myself.

This probably gives you an idea about my social anxiety. 
I have an okay job, I get along with the people who I work with, it's probably cause they are all so much older than me (Many about 50yo and im 18). 
Today at work I fantasizesed about having to courage to kill myself, maybe some day.
But now that you know a little about me, back to what I was trying to say, as an extremely introverted person, who has really no friends, is too scared to go out to meet new people, and Im not even sure where I would find anyone who I can be completely honest with, without them getting weirded out by me. And the worst part is that I don't have any excuses and it's burning my insides, that's probably the reason death is attracting me. 
See, what I really am and what I seem are two completely different thingd on the outside Im a athletic and a decent looking young guy, with alot of money and all the good cards in life, but under the skin it's a very different story, Im extremely anxious teen who is battling depression and extremely lonely.

199,t3_diypz2,What to do?,"
I can't stop thinking about you. I met her only 4 maybe 5 months ago. I mean I'd seen her around and always saw her with this senior football player. And I always thought they were madly in love. She was a beauty from the beginning. Her delicate face her sweet smiles. This was in the spring so School ended and I didn't think much of her. About a month goes by and I here about her having a rough break up with him. That hurts cause I know the feeling of not wanting it to end thinking it'll go well and then it doesn't. Then In late July early August I met her. Like 5 feet tall yet this girl stood out. She had this joy to her that made others want to smile. She cares, she may have known the person for 5 minutes or 5 years but it didn't matter because she cared. Then I guess she noticed me by chance I was abrupt enough to force my way into talking with her. Over the next 4 days or so I remember tying to spend as much time at fair as possible with her. She worked tho booth in the evening so most nights I'd stand by the booth and act like I was helping only to be even near her. To hear her kind jokes and feel her playful punches. I remember walking with her one night and she told me about her concerns with this guy she was seeing. She wasn't quite ready maybe and she didn't know if I'd go anywhere. You know what I told her? ""Give it a chance. I know him he's great. Do what's best for you but maybe give him a chance."" Over the next couple days I saw her a few more times. Then about a week later we where both at a little pool party together. As the sunset and the swimming ended a dark demon lurked over her. The thought of a man she used to love. She couldn't shake how much she missed him. Yet once again I found myself listening to this angel sing about the pains in her chest. She told me of worries about the relationship going anywhere. And if she saw herself with these people for all of life. That night I was more in love with her than at any point leading up to this. Then out of the blue she goes ""are you ok?"" I wasn't able to tell her my feelings so I complained about other struggles of the time including failing in football and a growing disconnect between me and my family. We could relate on many things, though I was apprehensive to give details. Yet that night she somehow said something and taught me a most wonderful thing. She says""don't be afraid to talk about your problems, I will listen."" I melted nobody ever really had said this to me. She made me understand that feelings are ok. I grew up with the same mentality most guys are born with ""suck it up"" is all you hear from everyone. She abruptly had to leave and she said her goodbyes. The rest if my summer I only saw her at a school activities and I didn't have much time to talk. But this girl has not left my mind since then. I see her everyday and I spend at least 1/4 of my day with her. I probably look like a lost puppy. She's still this guy. I want her to be happy but when's my chance. I've been told by everyone who I tell about it to just forget about her. But she's worth more than that. She likes to ask all the time if I'm ok?

Edit for context if anyone cares my stage of life : 18M

Started antidepressants sometime around 2018 Summer, and ended up in inpatient therapy for suicide attempt in September.

During this time period I was put on an ABUNDANCE of different prescriptions, to which I recall about 7 different ones, ranging from SSRIs(Celexa, lexapro, 2 others I can't remember name of), Benzos(Ativan, Klonopin), and others I dont know what genre they fall under like wellbutrin and trazadone.

This was all in around a 2-4 month time period being put on all of these.

In fall I developed blood issues, which a side effect of wellbutrin and some of the benzos had something in their side effects with blood issues I went cold turkey on those, as well as have gone cold turkey on my SSRI's beforehand already for just feeling generally unwell.

Fast forward, its now been a whole year.

I do not like at all to talk to anyone about mental health or depression hence the throwaway, but dear god it has been fucking hell with panic attack after panic attack on a near daily basis

I have nightmares pretty much every night and it feels like depression has manifested itself physically and my brain constantly has electrical like impulses rippling through it when i'm upset and it feels like my body is attacking or rejecting itself. I fight with being depressed or just making up excuses for how I act and can't tell whats real anymore and when I'm actually upset.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend tells me everyday its because how I went cold turkey on medication but the thought of taking anymore makes me nauseous, (I only take ativan in high doses when I am near the edge) would medication be the underlying cause here? Am I just a crybaby? Is it neither of those and some people just have bad brain chemistry? Any insight please lol..",depression

I am a high school student in my senior year, from outside I look like an ordinary kid who loves playing video games and hanging out with friends. however,  from the inside is another story.

am dealing with anxiety and maybe depression because of my family,  don't get me wrong I am blessed with a great family that will do everything for me but all my family members are having problems and all of them are counting on me to help them and this is destroying me.

so let's take them one by one to make the picture clear:

1-my beloved mother: she is dealing with cancer and heart problems and counting on me to teach my little brother and help my father in his business

2-my father: he has been working all his life to make us happy and satisfied but he is tired now and have back problems and he wants me to work with him in our shop

3- my older sister: she is in my eyes my second mother I love her so much she always helps me with positive and kind attitude but when I entered high school I discovered that she is dealing with depression because of her weight and I really want to help her

4-my little brother: he is still a kid in 4th grade and on top of that I have 2 problems in my personal life: the first one is that I have a porn addiction for 5 years and the guilt is killing me, the second is that I am fat.

all of that without mentioning that I am in my senior year and I have a college application which is very stressful because I am the first one in my family to apply to college.

I really want to run away from all of these responsibilities and be free but I can't because my family needs me.

I have tried to wean off may times in the past, but it's been a disaster every time.  I am resigned to taking meds forever, as I am suicidal without them.  ANYWAY... I enjoy life so much more when I get to take a small dose of cannabis every evening to wind down (it has replaced alcohol), and I REALLY want to continue my cannabis habit, BUT I've noticed that it seems to be lessening the efficacy of my meds... I find myself feeling like I'm not even on meds during the day, and it's scary.  I can't talk to my doctor about it, because I know exactly what she'll say... she's anti-cannabis.  HAS ANYBODY HAD THIS EXPERIENCE?  IF SO, HOW DID YOU REMEDY IT?  TIA",depression

Im due to finish my college program in December but I'm in roughly 6k debt so I'd like to work part time in a restaurant since before this all began I worked for a few years in that environment. I feel like I'll have to lie on my resume by making it seem like I've worked recently but that doesn't help my already low self esteem. 

Should I just find restaurants hiring on indeed and go speak to the manager in person? Idk I just don't want to have to explain myself and get their pit

217,t3_divd4b,How to learn to love myself at 49 years of age,"I just need to rant, or just to get this out of my system.

I am a male who is nearly 50 and most of the time I get along well enough, but lately I have been having stress at work, and I find it has made me hate myself, as it has dredged up past failures and reminded me that try as I might I cannot think and act like 'normal' people.

On paper I am highly intelligent (multilingual, passionate historian, etc.) but in reality I feel deeply inferior: I have some autistic/dyspraxic disorder that means I can neither swim nor drive, and I hate myself for it. And it takes me ages to learn some things that most people know after being told only once. This is causing me angst at work at present.

I am just tired of fighting. I am tired of being my own worst enemy. I am ok at the moment, but the storms are getting more and more terrible as the years go by and I still feel I remain as unskilled and bizarre and thick as ever.

Anyways, I just want to say i'm thinking about you all as the season is changing, I know and understand how this time of the year can get harder, especially with christmas coming up, as it's not always a joyous time for everyone. 

I can't offer much, i'm not necessarily equiped emotionally/psychologically, but just know that someone in this world is thinking of you and supporting you during those difficult days. 

Know that I hopes you'll reach out to someone you trust or an organization if this season becomes unbearable. 

Know that I trust in your capacities, as a human being, to get through this, however long it's been.

And finally, don't be afraid to ask a professional for some help, there's no shame in recognizing when you have reached your limit.

So I usually don’t do this and I’m not sure if anyone will respond but I just feel like I need to say something, for the last 2 years I have been at rock bottom, I don’t have anyone to reply on at the end of the day it’s just me. Everyone I talk to I just can’t connect with and I just feel like they don’t like me or care about me or anything I have to do with. I don’t do anything to make people hate me I just put it in my head and it begins to spread into the relationship with people. My co workers who say they are my friends say they care about me but when they see that I’m in a depressed mood they don’t do anything. I just feel like they are only in my life because of work. I have been thinking in my head every day that the world would be a better place if I weren’t in it people would just be happier to not have to deal with me. I even go to the point where I will make up reasons or find reasons to prove my point, even if I’m taking to a wrong way. I do this in every situation and just keep telling myself people don’t care about me and ride the proof to make it true. It makes me feel like The world would be better off with out me.",depression

I can’t try again because I’ll end up in an awful psych ward again. I struggle to think of how this is better than death.

I would like to flirt with a girl i like but i don't know how to do it right. I always skrew up and show no interest. I'm used to not showing my interest to girls as i always knew they didn't like me. Now that i lost weight, grew and have long hair girls are interested in me and i don't know what to do. Now if there's a girl i like actualy shows intrest in me i blow it as i don't know one thing about relationships as i never had one. Every time i see myself screw up with a girl i feel worse and worse. Now I screwed up with a nice girl and i'm as lonely as ever. Was it that i didn't like her or was it that i can't let myself love? I don't know. And who cares. I know i shouldn't but I stil do. I do not feel sad for myself. There are people who have it worse. These are just some thought's i couldn't show to the public.

225,t3_dj0x1n,I have to break up with the person I love because of long distance,"I've suffered from depression and anxiety at varying intensity for at least 6 years now. I basically got used to being somewhat unhappy most of the time. I had a really bad relationship for 2 years in which I was treated as an afterthought and eventually dumped. I thought I'd have some fun fucking around on Tinder and downloaded it soon after being dumped, only to meet someone incredible shortly after. They ticked every box for me and made me feel so special, loved, and secure. For 5 months I woke up with a smile on my face every day and finally felt like I was living and enjoying life. Now because of work visa issues they have to go back to their country, we are from different continents. They won't be able to return for at least a year and don't want to restart their lives over and over, so we'll be ending the relationship. 

I'm in the lowest mental state I've ever been in. I've gained weight and feel like everything around me is out of my control. I cry every night and can barely function, dishes are piling up and I come to work late every day. I can't pull myself out of this, I have no energy left.

They already have enough problems and issues in their own lives and I cannot add onto that. I feel like they hate me but logically I know they don't. I only feel they hate me is because of the negativity in the damn brain, which makes me into a complete and utter irritated asshole.

The other thing is the death itself. I've contemplated countless times. But I don't have a belief. I believe when you die it's all over. There's nothing. I don't know what holds me back from facing that, maybe its just the slim chance of hope.
The reasoning behind why I want to die is because I feel I don't belong in this world. I shouldn't be here. I'm so terribly out of connection with people. I am worthless. I show no purpose in the world I am currently living in and I feel more like a sack meant to look like a person moreso than acting like one. People around me obviously don't see me as an actual person worth talking to. I get talked down to even by people similar to me in real life, due to me being so incredibly quiet and unfocused in my own mind.

What the name of it is, is not important. What is important that for almost 10 years now I've been obeying voices in my head and trying to appease them to make them go away. When I was 10 I was at first diagnosed with OCD, after a short while my mother noticed that some of my ticks and symptoms didn't seem normal for a child with OCD. I was later diagnosed with tourettes, but again the symptoms didn't match. Finally after visiting a specialist I was diagnosed with a widely unknown and extremely rare mental illness that has affected my life ever since. Over the years the voices would tell me to do different things and give me various rules to follow that were similar to OCD. However, they constantly have changed and now it's at a point where I just can't get a moment of relief unless I'm completely asleep. My dreams are my only safe haven. It doesn't seem like a day goes by where I don't think about just ending it, but I refuse to because of how caring my mother has been to me throughout my life. In all honesty if I didn't have her, I would probably just end it. I've been trying various medications for years but they never go away. There was only one instance when I was 15 that I was put on celexa and all my symptoms went away and for the first time in years, I truly felt the bliss of being a normal human being. This was to be short lived, as soon after the voices commanded me to abide by new rules that hadn't existed before then and I was back to where I was. Despite being hard to fit in and function at school peers, I managed and hung out with a relatively popular friend group during the rest of my high school career. Hanging out with my friends on weekends and over the summer gave me a pseudo feeling of bliss, not like I had before, but it took my mind off the voices. However high school is long gone and all my friends are at college. I tried to commuting to a local university, but found it hard to focus in class. That's something I forgot to mention. I used to excel in academics up until fifth grade, when my illness completely took over. I managed to bullshit my way through graduating high school because believe it or not, all it really takes to graduate is to show up and give like 30% effort. So here I am now, alone, in the dark, and I have no idea what to do. It feels like everyday I become less and less human. I would give anything just for one day of being normal. I have friends and have had several girlfriends, but with them all gone and me still here, I'm alone with just my thoughts and the voices. It's overwhelming. Has anyone had a similar experience that has a solution. I know I can feel bliss again like I did the short couple of days when I was 15. I just need an answer.",depression

242,t3_dixw8t,Thought Dump.,"I’m sorry I don’t have anyone to talk to anymore so I thought I’d just post my thoughts here to get them out of my head. 

I’m in a mess, a complete mess. I won’t say it’s the lowest I’ve been but I am really struggling. 

Me and my partner were supposed to be moving into a house owned by his mother to start afresh as we (mainly me) hate where we currently live but are trapped in negative equity. That hasn’t worked out, infact I never want to talk to his mother again, as you can imagine this has caused a lot of friction. She completely went back on all of the agreements we had made and waited months for. 

My relationship has plummeted. We have been together for 8 years but the stress of him starting a business (originally meant to be a partnership but he decided to make it just him solo) him borrowing money from me with no sight of paying me back and the business not performing as well as expected it’s caused a lot of worries for me. I wish I hadn’t been bumped out, I wish his parents had invested instead of me having to put up money at the last moment, I wish he had never bought it. We can’t get a break, it’s constant. 

I’m not interested in sex, I never really was but I just don’t get the point honestly. I don’t really feel anything, I’m too self conscious to let my bf attempt a proper warm up, and it’s pushing my partner away. I just eat crap, and I’m getting fat and grey but I can’t be arsed to change anything, everything just seems too hard! 

I hate the flat where we live, I hate there’s a massive scout hit being built opposite, I hate the lack of parking and feeling overlooked. I just wanted a garden, I love gardening, and a place for my three dogs to enjoy their lives. I hate thinking they might die of old age before getting a garden, it kills me. My partners business means we might not be able to move for five year’s. Four years has made me like this already. 

I’m training to become a teacher, well I’m on the course, but I think I just chose it randomly. I keep flitting between jobs trying to find my place, especially after being cast out of the business, but I can’t find it. I struggle with money a lot obviously because of this. 

Tonight after the let down with the house, and arguing with my partner I just wanted to return some tools to my parents. It didn’t work out haha. The paint exploded in my car, the one thing I was really proud of. My sister and dad had to waste three hours trying to clean it up, I couldn’t even drive it home. Just another fucking problem and more money and I hate myself because it was my fault. I was in a rush yesterday to get out of his mothers house and I fucked up the placement of the paint. 

I was really proud of myself in January, I went to a bastille concert on my own in Manchester after freaking out at another one and having to leave after a panic attack. I bought a hoody and I was wearing it when the paint exploded. It’s in the bin now. I have to try and get it fixed tomorrow but I don’t want to face my family at all. I wish I could disappear. Take the dogs and my car and drive to Scotland and get a false identity and talk with a weird accent and live in a cave. I don’t even have my car for that anymore though. 

My mums fed up with me. My sister is fed up with me and my partner is fed up with me too. They say I need to get over things. That I’m too negative. That I react badly to everything. But I can’t help it. All the time I’m awake my head is screaming and crying and sometimes when I’m in shock it just leaks out of me. I don’t get the point of living, honestly I wish there was a button I could press to stop. I’ve been to doctors and gone on antidepressants and it doesn’t help me I don’t think. 

I want to die, I want to die so much but I can’t make myself do it.

It's getting to the point at the moment though where I feel like I really should start taking them but I'm just worried the side effects might actually make me feel worse by putting on weight for example and several other things I've heard a lot about. I guess really I'm just trying to understand the kind of likelihood of certain side effects and how others have dealt with them. Is it worth it ect? 

Mostly it would be to treat anxiety but also a lot of underlying depression.

I dont know how to really be truthful and be a friend if I never really had one you know? I want relationships and connections but having been solo has taken its toll and I just cant be arsed to make friends or be social for that matter.

250,t3_dixs8u,Long-term loneliness,"My life is very routine, empty and meaningless. I live alone, I work nights as a short-haul trucker delivering refrigerated stuff, and I spend most of my days/nights off sleeping and drinking, lacking the motivation to break out of the cycle. I occasionally go to meetups, where I often feel out of place and awkward when others there seem so much more accomplished, confident, less socially retarded than I, though these meetups are frequently at a venue that serves alcohol which helps a little.

I don't have anyone I can call to hang out with, or even just talk to about my day. I am a never-married bachelor and I've almost always been single. I feel like I've always been invisible to women and I never developed the confidence to approach them, nor the social acuity to read their signals and know when and how to escalate things. The few times I've had (very short-term) girlfriends over the years, it's been by sheer luck. I have the dating/romantic experience of someone less than half my age (I am 41), and indeed I feel stunted at that age in some ways; it's hard for me to relate to my peers, most of whom are much better established financially, socially, and romantically. I should mention I'm on the mild high-functioning end of autism spectrum, so that didn't help me when I was younger and I failed to develop the social skills that everything else would build upon later on.

I exist in this little bubble of reality, a parallel world, like a spectator. I have the material things, the basics- roof over my head, nice car, job. But the truth is, we all know that isn't enough. There's a crucial step in the hierarchy of needs missing in my life, a rung missing in the ladder to climb out of this hole. Yet I feel so powerless to fix it, like it's too late, so I resume a sort of autopilot and just tune it out and go through the motions of existing.

I've settled into a very deep depression that is like a comfortable bed; at some point I know I have to get up and out of it, but it's easier to just lay there, doze, and not feel anything. Only occasionally do I break down and cry, but of course, there is no one to hear or dry my tears. I am so lonely it hurts. I've long ago realized love isn't for me, that it's something other people experience, and it's been hard to come to terms with that. It's like a constant sense of mourning.

I don't see the point in carrying on. I'm not sure I want to die, per se; I'm not actively suicidal, I just don't want to exist anymore.",depression

I have a job that I don't mind but fuck I want more. I want something that I'll be happy doing and honestly I don't know that that is. I have no clue what makes me happy or how to be happy because I feel so miserable all the fucking time. I had a job in the summer where I met my girlfriend working as a camp counselor(something that will not pay the bills) and it was the first time I had felt alive. Running around with kids, saying fuck my physical health and pushing through(just learned the pain in my shoulder for the past year has been a tear in my rotator cuff and I have to get surgery) and I was having so much fun. I met a girl who I have never felt so at home with than her. Then I got a job that was 2 hours away and moved closer to it, sat in between the two places and my gf would stay with me from time to time, but it put me into a dark depression because I hated it. I hated the job so I quit and moved back to the city I left. I got a job that I'm now 10 minutes from and makes me much more money. I was a chemistry major and I'm working as a lab tech. But fuck me its not getting better mentally. I think I want to kill myself. Like I hate everything now. My girlfriend and I's relationship is so strained right now because she doesn't know if she can be with someone who just is so upset because she's had mental issues of her own. I feel like she deserves better than my depressed ass and I'm trying so hard to keep it together yet every time I think of the summer I just bawl my eyes out because I was happy for once. before that summer I was also about to say fuck everything...

I dreaded going to the hospital today. The thought consumed me, for I knew how it would play out, and indeed, the questions she asked were like a knife stabbing me in the gut relentlessly.

I wish she would stop swirling the blade. I wish I could just get up and leave. I almost felt like snatching her pen and sticking myself in the throat with it. Almost, almost, almost. (Instead of making her suffer the horrible sight of suicide, I just hit myself repeatedly once I was home.)

No, I don't have any friends/am not in a relationship. No, I've never been happy. Yes, the medications were ineffective. Yes, I still suffer from seemingly random bursts of physical pain. No (lie), I am not currently suicidal. Yes (lie), I enjoy my classes.

And she kept pushing therapy on me, as though it has ever helped (but I implore you to go to therapy and try various types; I'm simply too far gone). I'm drowning in debt from how much I've been on the ambulance, along with being admitted to the psych ward so many times in such rapid succession.

My father almost lost it when he found out how much I owe, as my mother looked on in horror.

She would ask me about college, until I finally begged her to please avoid mentioning that cursed word. Hearing it brings back nightmares from the first college I attended, though I didn't say this. She replied that she only wanted to check on me—that maybe today had been different!

I'm sorry, but no. It's all the same. Try as I might, people dislike me, because I'm boring, weird, stupid, quiet, etc, etc. I don't know why I couldn't be born as pretty and outspoken as you. I'm sorry you gave birth to such a beast of a daughter, yet all I can do is apologize.

Someone I met online recently told me that they envision themselves either living on the streets or behind bars. I see myself becoming homeless. This just isn't working!

I'm not even any good at my hobbies, which people couldn't care less about, and my imaginary world isn't safe; it merely reflects my instability, whenever I'm like this.

259,t3_di9zcf,"If you're a young person struggling with depression, please take a couple of minutes to read this post.","I was first diagnosed with depression at age 11 after some traumatic events. I saw and experienced things that year that no child should ever have to. My family noticed something was amiss but for whatever reason nothing was done and a couple of years passed. At age 13 I started high school, hormones were developing, stresses of classes and schoolwork became too much, there were also factors at home around this time too. It was blatant something was very wrong by now and they must've realised they could no longer turn a blind eye.  I was booked in to see a psychiatrist, who decided it was in my best interest to be booked asap into a children's psychiatric ward. I was terrified, I didn't know what was going on inside my brain, and now I was being forced to stay somewhere away from my family. I met a girl and two boys there, Kristy, James &amp; James (yes). We became inseparable. I can still remember one of the James' curls, oh I was besotted, but... I digress, that isn't important. The four of us gave each other comfort, we related to each other, we had been through some bs and now we were trying to get some help. Eventually, our time was up, one by one we were released from the hospital and lost contact. This is long before the days of social media and mobile phones.  I went home, but it no longer felt like home and somehow, my depression was even worse than before, so I ran away. Now, I'm going to fastrack to the present moment. I'm 39 years old. Since the day I left that hospital ward some 25 years ago, my depression has been left untreated. Why? Because I felt like talking to a professional and/or taking medication would be futile. Slowly over the years things got worse and worse. Let me tell you about myself as I sit here today. I can't look at myself in the mirror without feeling shame and disgust. I leave my house only when I need groceries or have to see a Dr - because of this I'm unable to hold a job down, rely solely on government benefits and barely have money once rent is paid, food is bought and bills are taken care of, sometimes there isn't even enough to cover the bills.  I have no friends, 0, because I push people away. I am only content when I'm alone in my bedroom, my safe space where nobody can look at me, thus making it impossible to ever dream of having a boyfriend. Even when it comes to my family, I struggle in their company. I have no interest in what they have to say, I just hit them with small talk and one word replies because I'm so uncomfortable and just want them to leave me be. I hate talking on the phone, I am even begrudged responding to texts. They are not bad people, they just happen to be related to someone who is so crippled with mental illness that she can't even function as an adult anymore. I can't even look them in the eye at this point, I can't look anyone in the eye but I specifically refer to my family because, well, if you can't even relate to your own family - who can you relate to? Multiple times throughout every day I have to talk myself out of suicide. I'm not living, I'm just existing. I'm laying myself out bare here not because I want your pity - but because I want you to go and get the help that you need. You are a good person worthy of being happy, and by not getting your depression looked at, you're doing yourself and those closest to you a huge disservice. Don't let depression define you as I have, don't wake up one day 20 years from now and come to the bleak conclusion that you literally wasted your entire life battling this illness. Talk to your school counselor, talk to your best friend, talk to your parents, talk to your GP, tell someone how you're feeling, let them help you, let them in. If my story can help inspire even 1 person to take that huge step, I'll be happy.",depression

I'm terrified of my future. I have huge goals, if I totally expressed all the things I want to do in my life, I would be called mad. Seriously.

Yet... I feel like I can do it. I am smart enough, I have creativity... If I get the opportunity to express myself, I think I will blow everyone away !

But, I have no fear of death. Worse, a part of me sincerely wants to die. I think I haven't killed myself because I'm afraid of failing and having to explain to everyone what happened. I don't know what is wrong with, HOW other people don't feel that way, but, I just think ""Well... If things go wrong, I can just die."" and that's a serious thought.
I don't feel like hurting myself, I don't do self-harm, I don't have any eating disorder... But if a ""you can die right now"" button existed, I would probably have used it, or will use it somedays.

I don't know what's wrong with me... It's just so much easier. All the pain, bad feelings, sadness can just go away. It's so simple.

I can't deny that some of my best /perhaps most meaningful, or detailed stuff has been made while going through some horrible shit. A lot of it has. A lot of my favourite drawings were done while feeling suicidal. That does not mean depression is good whatsoever. It just means a drastic and painful problem manifested in a way that happened to come out cool.

Initially art was a hobby of mine, then it became a method of expression and escapism simultaneously. Then eventually it became something I wanted to pursue a career in. I have drawn roughly every day the past 9 years. This year my depression has been hammering my motivation more and more and more, I thought it was burn out finally catching up with me, which may be part of the problem, but my depression is the worst of it.

 I still love to draw but...this is the other side of things. Depression might sometimes fuel you to make a masterpiece, but it can also drag you to a total halt. Dragging your motivation down and down and down. Telling you that making art is a waste of time. Telling you that the art isn't good enough. 

Depression isn't making me produce detailed, emotional work anymore. It's made it impossible to produce anything at all, and any attempts get scrapped because I see them as having been a waste of time. I WANT to draw. I ENJOY drawing. Not being able to is eating me alive, it's making my depression even worse.

This is all probably worded horrendously and im sorry about that, but it's just the worst feeling on Earth to not be able to create any more. I feel completely useless. I just lay in bed all day unable to do anything. It's hard to even sketch. It hurts.

So my idea maybe.. anyone try meditation? Calming music? Looking into spirituality.. astral projection?? Personally I’m getting a sense of connection.. something I’ve lacked in my severe depressed stages in my life. Looking into these aspects and seeing if it could help others out. 

I spent my time from 16-22 reading, watching tv/movies/video games.. (still can but toddler prevents some of that) things I’m thinking we all probably have in common. Easy passer bys that can distract us from our feeling of hopelessness in reality. 

So as you probably lay in bed feeling miserable and hopeless (like I have) maybe check our some YouTube videos in this? See if it can help and find a new meaning. An ulterior method of passing time and may find some enlightening? That’s my hope for posting this. I’ve gone out and purchased some sage, inscents that are “positive vibes/zodiac” and have looked into some empath or Astral Projection topics. Even reddit sub group here. My next weekend I don’t have my toddler I’ll be takin the weekend and really diving into it. I feel at a crossroad and several look gloomy and hoping I myself can find something deeper within to guide me.. 

Hope this can help or if anything give a different perspective and something different to read on this group..",depression

I met this woman (maybe in her early 50s?) who has a lot in common with me. I feel like because she’s older it’ll be easier to become friends because there’s none of that generational fake, petty stuff- which really gets to my anxiety.

282,t3_dizwsg,For the treatments résistant depression,"Hey, after some research it seems that more and more begin to rely on microdosing  magic mushrooms, I saw several independent studies being held that  seems to show that even the more fucked up and disabled manages to recover some of their mood and enough energies to begin functioning again, but it seems that there is a silver lining, the effect might stop once you stop microdosing it and revert to your state pre consumption.
Now that psilocybin and magic shrooms are illegal everywhere, the better would be to learn how to grow them to have your own supply and use it purposely for yourself without telling anyone.
I think It might take to take more or less à decades before they are considered in treatment and gradually replace big pharma monopole with antidepressant.",depression

I'm 20 y/o, Brazilian girl, with a narcissistic mother and a distant dad. I have 2 sister and 2 brothers, that I don't talk much with.. and this year has been the most terrible year I've ever been through. I hate my college, I'm unemployed, I have the lower self esteem ever, I'm dumb, socialy awkward, ugly af, fat and I have an awful personality, last month I accidentally kill my baby cat, cause I take painkillers for my kidney stone (I really don't want to talk about it, since I really loved her and I still didn't recovered from grief), I'm broke, in debt with a bank and the list can go on and on.. sometimes I think ""wait, but you have lovely friends, and a lovely boyfriend, a cat and 3 hamsters that will miss you"" but that's never enough.. they'll all be better without em in their lives, I'm unstable... in the last 2 weeks, my mom yelled at me cos I can't get out of my room. I feel my boyfriend is getting distant, and I really don't wanna put all my problems into my friends lives.. I feel like I'm a burden and I can't take it anymore.. I'm tired of being average or lower at everything I do. I'm not a good artist, I' not a good daughter, a good student, I suck at any job I start, I'm the ugliest, the dumbest, and awkward kid in family. I'm a failure.. I feel that I don't have any purpose in life, like, I can't think I'm strong enough to deal with my problems to overcome the situation and eventually get better.. Today I tried to slit my wrists, and for some reason, it didn't work. The knife was sharp and I didn't even let marks.. I'm useless even to kill myself?

Yesterday it was finding a creative outlet, and I physically wouldn’t let myself rest until I made some sort of creative masterpiece (it was terrible btw) and today I’m glad to say that I have a real crisis (some insignificant school thing that’s somehow destroying me) I’m so fucking sad here’s just a fun vent. I’m too dependant, I worry more about looking alone than I do of actually being alone, I’m never interesting enough, my one real friend is starting to replace me, and I have GAD, social anxiety and (you guessed it) depression. Isn’t life so fun!! I have a naturally isolationist personality while still somehow being clingy and I’m also fundamentally broken. Not once from birth can I remember actually having a purpose in this world instead of clinging to whatever I found before I started getting bad at it/ being replaced. My life’s going to shit and I finally decided to make a big move and getting a therapist and I hate her damn much that I want to quit already. I’ve also destroyed an old friends life by leaving her and her sister (the sister was toxic not her) and I miss how loyal she was. I swim in shame. I’m always humiliated. Constantly trapped and running. I go insane on an instant. It feels like my life stopped a year ago. 
Alright I got the feels out I’m going to calm down now. If anyone sees this I wish you good luck. My life motto is: as long as you try.

289,t3_diwzmx,My life is at a stand still,"No ones knows i've been thinking about ending it... for years now. and I know that one day I will, maybe not now... but i don't think i'll make it to 30... I'm in my mid 20's...

in the past 2 years i've attempted to do so 4 different times, planned and prepared everything out, but decided last minute that this wasn't the right time to go about it.

my first ever attempt was in middle school... i also used to cut back than, without leaving scars, since its the actual pain i was after and not a reminder of it. I don't do that anymore... but i do scratch myself sometimes, when i feel like i need it...  
my mom didn't really know this was going on ,though i do suspect that my younger sister told her i was hurting myself in some way (and come summer it became harder to hide my arms or hands), and she decided we should move away to the city (also to be closer to my dad and his family, and she also though it'll make things easier for us). I was 14, going on 15, when we moved.

for a few years things were actually ok.   
I started seeing a therapist once a week right after we moved to the city, but wasn't able to actually talk to her about all the unexplained sadness and dark thoughts... to this day there's no one in the universe but me who knows about this... I can never bring myself to talk about it. 

i left home when  i was 22, to go to university (2-3 hours away from my parents), and it was about that time that things started to go south again. and after one year of school i dropped out.  
Although i had friends, and was in a relationship for most of that year, after a while everything felt dark again.  
So i started working instead, for a few months... ever since i quit my job in march i haven't really worked, i tutor sometimes, but thats about it. My dad pays my rent and bills, and both him and my mom send me money a few times a month. money i usually use to buy weed (which is not cheap in my country, like 10-15$ per gram).

I've been lying to every person in my life. Mostly my parents.  
I've been telling them for a few months now that i've been job searching but no ones calling me to come interview when in reality the last time i spent time searching and applying was about 2 months ago.

I live by myself with 2 cats (which i adopted thinking it'll help me, i love them, but that's about it) and have been spending my days reading, watching Netflix/youtube and smoking non stop (either weed or tobacco).  
I used to be very artistic once... used to write stories, paint... even made jewelry at some point... but i cant bring myself to do that now. I just don't have the will to.  
when i don't have money for weed, i steal some from my cousin... he lives close by and we became good friends over the last year. I even broke into his apartment twice when he wasnt home (I know where the spare key is, so i dont think that really counts as B&amp;E). I even stole some when he left the room a few times. he, of course, has no idea.

I even lost my will to eat, which resulted in a 20+ kilo weight loss (which i'm not mad about... I weigh 68kilo now, and i'm 174cm). it's not that i starve myself... i just don't see the point in eating, until my stomach hurts to much to focus on whatever it is i'm watching/reading (as i said, i don't do anything else).

I rarely answer calls or texts, only if its from my parents or my cousin (since they get super worried if i don't answer at least once a day, and start asking questions).

I no longer have an interest in having a romantic relationship with anyone... I still try to date, since that's what everyone's doing, but after one date i just ghost them.

I'm a burden to everyone around me, mostly my parents. I'm like a cancer that's slowly spreading, becoming harder and harder to deal with.

I don't see the point in anything anymore... and spend every waking moment waiting until my body is tired enough to actually sleep (which doesnt happen often... i'm usually awake... and just sleep for like 6 hours every 2 days). My life is literally at a stand still, there's no point in moving forward... 

I don't know what else to say... I've been considering posting here for a while now... just to have my thoughts out in the open for once.

Just... don't be too harsh on me...?

I did that for years but only now I understand why I do it. I don't want to but I just can't hold it no matter how hard I try.

293,t3_dizp6k,Where to go from here?,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest thoughts as a kid were of worthlessness and death and it still drags me down to this day. I am unemployed, on the verge of homelessness(about 2-3 months away) and I have addiction issues (alcohol, cigarettes and weed). I keep getting to myself to that point where I want to die, but I feel like I don't have the balls to do it myself, which feeds back into feeling worthlessness. I'm not man enough to 'check out' on my own. My family and friends have been wanting me to get help, almost on a daily basis but I always get scared and feel like there's other people out there who need help way more than I do and I would just be taking space in the system when someone more worthy could get help. A few things: I live in Ontario,Canada and I have the 'old' health card and no other pieces of I.D except my S.I.N card and a barely readable Birth Certificate. I get anxious  and nervous easily so renewing my I.D has felt impossible, my drivers licence expired in 2008. How would I go about getting help? Everyone wants me to just find a clinic and walk-in and tell them everything but last time I tried something like that the attendant at the clinic got really mad at me not having the proper ID and stuff. I'm lucky to be living at a friend's house, and he's been patient with me but he has his limits, and he's moving out soon to a brand new place with no room for me. I've been living my life on my bed. I can feel my body getting weaker with each passing day but I just can't seem to get up and out, my sleep schedule is ridiculous. I'll sleep for about 5-15 minutes and wake up in a cold sweat after having crazy, memory altering dreams. I have dreams so like the real world that I often wonder what's real and what's not.

294,t3_dipuwb,I went on a dating show and now I am heavily regretting it.,"I've more or less been single all my life and had accepted that I was gonna die alone. It used to upset me greatly but there are times where I just accept it and think ""well what the fuck can you do, better get on with the rest of your life"".

So even though I feel like this, and I try to tell myself that I have to accept it, I couldn't help but get upset about being a lonely singleton. Every single one of my friends were either in a relationship or just started one, or had so many one night stands that it never bothered them. But I am always the third wheel who goes home alone at the end of a long days work or a fun night out. 

My friend went on a dating show, and it was actually a really funny episode. He didn't get the second date (nor did he want it after meeting her) but the amount of people talking about his episode and how funny he is was cool to see. So when I seen an advertisement looking for singles in my area, I thought ""why the fuck not"". I applied and actually got on the show.

I was SO EXCITED when this came around. I get to go on a date with this really cute guy, and if it works out then I won't have to be alone all the time. And if it doesn't work out, well atleast I'll have some more confidence to go on more dates, especially seeing how many compliments my friend got from his episode.

The date was fun and interesting, I really enjoyed the hour or so I spent with my date. There were some awkward moments at times I'm not gonna lie, and after the date when the cameras stopped rolling, we were still talking and we said how fun the date was. The producers split us up and we went our separate ways.

After 3 weeks of hearing nothing, I started to get super anxious thinking about how the date would come across on camera. Over time I came back to reality and had a long hard look in the mirror and remember when a badly proportioned fat idiot I was for thinking this would be a good idea. It's gonna be a total cringe fest and I know how bad I'm gonna look on the show. 

It's now been three months since I went on the date and now the advertisements are starting on TV for the show. I am really dreading my episode airing. The first episode already aired and I have no idea when my episode is gonna be on. Everyone is gonna see this fat ugly blob punching above his weight and answering silly pick up lines. It's obvious I didn't get the second date and now I can't help but think what a fucking mistake this was. I've totally embarrassed myself on TV and my friends and family are gonna watch it, and there's no chance I'll get more dates now. There's nothing I can do because I'm from a small town where everybody knows everybody. I just want to hide from the world and hope they completely edit me out or just show 1 or 2 minutes and move on. I'm dreading every Monday night for it to pop up on TV and every single day feels like it has 72 hours. This was such a fucking mistake.

I'm tired all the time, I pass out standing up and in middle of walking. I sleep perfectly fine though I get a easy 9 - 10 hours of sleep. 

I'm always sore, the slightest movement hurts like im being cut by thousands of razors all across my body. My back is always feels tight and I guess air in my back(?) So I just pop it till it goes away. My neck is the same way if i don't pop it I cant move my head. My torso upper body( and, chest, shoulders, and arms) I can't do much without feeling a type of strain.

My nerves and muscles, my nerves got to the point of randomly spasms like a shot of pain that leaves me not able to move and lasts for what feel like ever maybe 8 - 12 minutes. I think it's nerves but also i cant feel much in certain parts of my body and sometimes it moves to another part and i can feel again in the original.
Muscles, I have random twitching that lasts hours and gdts to the point i can feel my bones start bending, I can't lift much nor divas much as i was able to like how you can do I can't do it without going through a tearing, burning,and a cutting pain.

And finally my mental health, it hasn't been great ever since I've stopped working out. But for awile it was pretty positive, now the last couple weeks I find the urge to get fucked up and cutting. I haven't got to the point of suicide yet but I do daydream about me getting shot, stabbed, tortured, or giving my life for someone( I really will give my life to a person I consider a friend). I've thought about how it would be if I wasn't around and the effects to people and how different it would be.

Watch BBC, have dinner and sleep. Wake up, have breakfast and go to work.
Working in a small accountancy practice, you just do what you gotta do, don’t need to talk to anyone.

I guess, I really lack social skills to just getup and get on with my life.

314,t3_diw5yc,"Is my lethargy depression, ADHD-pi, or a combination of the two?","(I originally posted this in r/ADHD, but the mods considered it as seeking medical advice and had it removed. Apologies in advance if this is not the appropriate sub to ask this question, if anyone knows of one, please let me know.)

So I'm not sure how to properly explain my situation, but I've suffered from both ADHD inattentive (with a few symptoms of hyperactivity) and depression for most of my life, predominately during my teenage years.

I've always been lethargic and unmotivated, and have been on Ritalin, Concerta, and now Adderall. I was also on a cocktail of anti-psychotics and at least one anti-depressant (Paxil). There were periods where I didn't take medication, but those are few and far in between. Right now I'm at a good-enough balance of meds (Adderall XR and IR once a day, two separate doses, Wellbutrin XL, and Lamotrigine/Lamictal), but I still suffer from an overall lack of initiative, motivation, and energy. I remember having a lot more energy as a young kid, but around the time I got my first computer at age 9-10, I started losing the vitality I used to have. I don't know if it's because I started sitting around more and not exercising due to have 24/7 internet access, but I gained a ton of weight when I was in middle school and remained obese until my senior year in high school (Oddly enough, I decided to come off all medications at the insistence of my parents, which was primarily Concerta and the aforementioned anti-psychotics). I was definitely more energetic and had motivation to exercise more, but the lethargy and lack of any drive seemed to replace itself with anxiety and uneasiness.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years back I had a pretty bad depressive episode and stopped going out, exercising, and watching what I ate. I drank more than I should have been and gained all my weight back. Now my energy levels are pretty much back down to the way they were when I was 14-16 (Which is where I remember it being the lowest). I got prescribed Adderall and went back on meds a few months ago, and I definitely do have an increase in focus and attention, but only when my meds are active. When they're not active, I revert back to my usual state, with the edge taken off slightly due to the additional of Wellbutrin into my system. Otherwise, I struggle to maintain jobs, relationships, or interest in my hobbies. I don't feel the desire to exercise, play video games, watch TV or movies, or do much of anything. I seldom masturbate anymore, and when I do it's mainly for the dopamine hit and not because I have pent-up sexual urges. I mainly just lie in bed all day thumbing through my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this mostly ADHD or is this largely depression? I am seeking therapy once a week, and seeing a psychiatrist once a month. Everyone kept telling me to seek treatment, and that's what I've been doing for the past six months, but I've yet to see anything but a slight improvement in my symptoms. Is it the lack of exercise and improper nutrition the major cause? I eat fast food regularly and still drink (albeit less so, about every 3 weeks). I'd get a physical, but my last one was in May 2019, and my doctor won't let me have another until next year. I would like to mention that my triglyceride count is fairly high, and if it went higher I'd have to seek treatment. Weight loss is a huge need right now, which is why I need an improvement in energy levels now more than ever if I want to keep my health in check. I'm 28, and I've read that your bad habits catch up with you in your late-20s/early-30s.

We dont even know how these drugs work but they are prescribing them to us. Some of the meds like lamictal can cause death. Other meds can leave you off worse than when you were off meds in the first place. I have seen some  horror stories on youtube about their experiences with meds.

I am starting a new major because I hated the one I was, I though this will help with my depression, but I am bad again and I am not going to my classes. The thing is that I enrolled a lot of them because I promised my parents I will finish University in two years. My major is a language and I barely speak it and when I attend the classes I feel very anxious: ""What if they ask me something and I don't know how to answer? All my classmates are going to think I am stupid... How I am going to make a presentation if I can't speak the language?!!!!""

If I don't pass all the classes, next year I will not have a scholarship, my parents are pushing me and I am lying to them all the time. I almost forgot why I am in college: I want to learn, I don't really mind about a future work because I don't know what I want to be, I just want to learn a new language and cool things. Everybody wants me to become ""someone with a well paid and important job"". But I don't have those ambitions, I just want a job that maybe it is related to books and that gives me time to read and write, nothing more. I don't need the urge to finisth University so quickly, I thought I wanted to graduate soon, but I don't really mind anymore. Maybe I should try to find a part-time job so I don't feel so bad about my poor parents paying me everything and meanwhile here I am, crying in my room instead of studying. The obligation to pass the subjects distorts everything and I get paralyzed and cannot do anything. I am starting with my bullimic old ways...

Well, I am tired of all this shit, I want to study again, but I don't know how to explain the teachers my problem and that I want to go to their classes again and that maybe I will need a bit of help to recoup (I don't know what word should I use here) the level. I think I might have to fail some and try to pass the control the second semester. In any case, I don't know how to explain  it to my teachers whithout crying or/and seeming pathetic and an opportunist. Now I can't study because I think about the level I have to get in such a little time, that it feels like an impossible task so I just don't study (it is silly, I know). How should I approach the teachers?

In my college we have free psychological assistance, so I called the past week to set an appointment and they said they will call me back. Well, they haven't done it yet, and I am getting crazier and crazier and noone wants to talk with me. When I speak with my friends, they will only tell me: ""eat well"" or ""go to a psychologist"". I am trying! They don't listen and I need to talk with someone about this. Maybe I will go to a priest to get everything off my chest, but I am scare that he will start to preach about the love of God and sins and I don't know...

Yesterday my dad told me he wants me gone by the end of the month. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. I am 25F and have always felt welcome to stay with my parents. Long story short on that note, my parents are divorced but live together. There is no good relationship there he just invited us to live with him after it became evident we were not doing well by ourselves. 

So after the past few months he has started asking us to pay sine of our personal bills when he never expected any money from us before. We both work low paying jobs. Not minimum wage but still not enough to live off of. We both told him we wanted to leave at some point. We’ve been saying so for years but this time he has a girlfriend and wants the house (that he rents and is much too big for him) and for us to both be out before the holidays. We’ve been through some hard times and any money we’ve saved up has had to been used almost entirely up. 

He seems to think we can just lie about how much money we make and extra income, etc and get an apartment. He recently texted my mom saying he knows there are dozens of apartments we can rent “in two hours if you cared.”

My depression is really hitting hard. I don’t know what to do. I know I’m leaving a lot out but it’s just so much to take in. We’ve been looking for weeks before he gave us a deadline. We have some relatives and friends willing to help but that can only go so far. I’m so overwhelmed and feel myself spiraling into a black hole with no way out. I wish it was just over.

It was my 21st birthday and shot glasses clinked,
But before then I have always heard a clink,
I was 3 years old and my dad came stumbling in the door, 
I had no idea what my parents were fighting for,
I heard my parents divorce was on the brink,
But I was only a toddler what was I suppose to think,
I could never understand, 
But my mom and dad held my hand,
My dad came home from having a drink, 
But after he passed out on the floor I heard the table clink,
I walked in the dining room door,
But found that he was passed out on the floor,
I looked at the table and saw a can,
And I put the drink in my hand,
I took a sip and it was gross, 
It was only then I realized that I missed my dad the most,
I thought it was sprite,
But something just didn't taste right,
It was beer,
But I was to young to know what was clear,
It was all a clink... it was all a clink, 
When I found out that you died, 
All I could do is cry,
It wasn't out of anger or that things got bad. 
It was that I would no longer have my dad.
Never thought I could be so sad. 
Or change so much,
But it was with you that I am now out of touch. 
I'm now 22 years old and all I hear is a clink,
I clean my cup in the sink that reminds me of my thoughts from last night,
But something didn't feel right,
You weren't there fixing my hair for school,
You weren't there telling me the ultimate life rule. 
You died and something in me went with it,
I wish that something could fit,
But I can no longer look forward to seeing you on the street, 
Or randomly see you in the local walmart where we would meet,
What could have been so bad? 
That you could not reach out to anyone my lovely Dad,
What took over all of your thoughts and pain,
What drove you away from all the things that made you sane. 
There's so much I want to tell you and all of the things to know that you would think,
But all I need is to start with the clink. 
The clink, the clink again, we need a clink to know where your thoughts began,
What hurt you so bad, I need to know dad,

It was my first familial loss, and though I was not close to him it still hit hard. It got me thinking about mortality, and I've just had feelings of futility, depression and hopelessness clouding my mind for a long time. I also think part of why it hit me was because I think his death was actually a suicide (for my own reasons).

342,t3_diyg1s,I feel like my life is in a cage and I can’t get out,Over the past year I never realized how depressed I am. I feel like I’m living in a cage and I can’t escape. Everything is always out of my control and I can’t escape it. I just want to break free. A year ago before I graduated high school I had a feeling my life was going to go this way but yet I had some optimism that I’ll be fine. I’m currently at a community college and all my friends have left but only one friend and I feel like I’m always alone. In high school I had a very high GPA and took 11 AP classes but graduated rank 120 out of 500 and was rejected by the school that was supposed to take me but the people who got in were the students who took a lot less advanced classes than me and got a higher GPA because they were easier classes so they graduated at a higher spot in my class. The school doesn’t even prioritize the students who took the hardest classes and just takes whoever had the highest GPAs regardless of the east classes they took. I’ve seen some people from high school that I graduated before are now getting accepted into the same school when most of them didn’t work as hard as I did and took the easy classes and I just feel so much anger that it always follows me. It proves how we don’t live in a meritocracy and that life doesn’t reward the people who work so hard and go the extra mile. I’m currently stuck at a community college I don’t want to be at trying to the classes done that I need to transfer for my major but my family is struggling right now to pay for the classes that I need when it’s so important right now. I’m trying to find a job for months now and haven’t had much luck. I have very little social interaction with anyone all I just do is come home even when I was in high school I had a lot of social interaction with my peers when I’m stuck in school for 8 hours a day and see a lot of people but now it’s not like that. My dream is to be a Physicist and I’ve been struggling lately in school with some classes but I keep on trying and my parents have suggested that maybe I should go a different route and it pains me because all I’ve ever wanted to do is be a Physicist and I feel as if I don’t get to be then there’s not much meaning to my life because back in high school when I was in the hospital for suicide watch it was Physics that helped give me purpose and a sense of direction that helped bring me out of it and I realized how the universe is so big and that it would seem like a waste not to be a Physicist because we only get one life. I just want to break free.,depression
343,t3_diyfse,Need to vent.,"I am not the best writer so I apologize ahead of time for my rambling. I've been struggling on and off with depression for about 4 years now. In college I visited a therapist who actually suggested that I might have bipolar 2 and recommended I do some reading on the topic and see if I fit the mold. I didn't listen and decided to stop seeing him. I figured that I'm a strong guy and I definitely don't have something ""like that"" wrong with me. It was all just a mindset issue. I decided to just keep on living and supplement my negative feelings with meditation, exercise, and drugs/alcohol. Fast forward to now. Since graduating college and working a full time job I have felt like the periods of ups and downs are far more pronounced and I am really struggling. I am fully convinced that I am living with bipolar 2. The past two cycles of mood in particular have been extreme and are testing me. I will go through a period of about a week or two where I am incredibly excited to go to work. I feel like I have a purpose, I love what I do, and I feel like I'm invincible. I go to the gym after work, I socialize, and I genuinely feel happy with my life and my future. I almost feel like I am on cocaine. All of this positivity grows greater and greater until one day, at the drop of a hat, everything comes crashing down. 

About three days ago I started to fall back to earth again... and then kept falling. Now all I want to do is cease to exist. I can't help but think about suicide. My commute is a little over an hour long and I spend the entire drive running through different ways to kill myself. I don't have the energy to work out. I get home, eat dinner, and lay down. I am 24 years old and when I am alone I will break out in tears. I feel like my head is cluttered and I am lost in life and worthless. Every decision I've made in the past has been a mistake, hell, being alive is a mistake. And these thoughts and feelings stick around for weeks until one day I wake up and begin to climb back towards positivity again. The cycle repeats. 

The worst thing is I that I still haven't done anything about it. I know I should go back to therapy or at the very least talk to my family about things but I don't. And I don't know why I don't.",depression
344,t3_divcjv,I really don't know how to keep going from here,"Everything is just so miserable, but there's no root to cut away to change things, I can't find any reason in particular that I feel like this, just... Everything is so awful....",depression
345,t3_ditetm,My motivation to live life is about to end,"TLDR; Suicidal my whole life, wanted a purpose found interest in a truck and im about to buy that truck so motivation = nothing now.

So everyone needs motivation to keep going right? Whether that be a new truck or getting that girl or that job promotion, we all need motivation to wake up daily. For me it is a new 2016 Toyota Tacoma. It costs an arm and a leg so I’ve been putting my life into getting all the money I have to buy it. I’m getting close to my goal and once I have this truck; i am scared I will no longer be happy. As of right now I am but that’s just because I have this as motivation.

Just kind of thinking outloud. This probably won’t get any upvotes but hey what else is new haha.

346,t3_diokmy,Alone,"I feel like I’m trapped behind a glass wall: let me elaborate. I see plenty of people every day but every single person I speak to shuts me down through either an insult or a simple “shut up”

It’s been so long since I’ve had an actual conversation without getting insulted 5 seconds into it. I’m starting to lose my sense of self and doubt every action I take in an effort to try and change the already foreseen outcome of the conversation.

I hold my sadness in and have done for years but it gets to a point where you can’t do it anymore. The same way a water tower can only hold so much water. Granted I don’t expect or even want a solution, i just want someone to respond to what I have to say like they would someone else.

347,t3_divc1c,How to talk to my husband,"Hello, y’all. 

I’ve been struggling with depression for about as long as I can remember. The October-February season is the worst for me. I have previously been hospitalized over the holidays for it and was HEAVILY medicated for a couple of years. With the guidance of my doctor and therapist, I decided to stop taking the meds for personal reasons. After 11 years of weekly (and some years of biweekly tossed in) therapy, I have some pretty efficient coping mechanisms in place and healthy outlets. 

This past weekend, the depression really took a toll on me. I’ve been exhausted and not motivated. I’ve become incredibly numb to everything. This week alone, I’ve missed a day of work and classes simply because leaving the house feels too big of a task for me. 

I love my husband and he does his best to support me, but he doesn’t understand this and believes that I am ALLOWING myself to feel this way and I can easily choose to not. I’m not really sure how to explain what I’m feeling in a better way for him. I know I won’t, but I am terribly afraid of being a disappointment to anyone and I feel as though I’ve failed myself and every one in my life by allowing myself to give in to the desire to isolate for a couple days. Any tips on better communicating how depression feels?",depression

I didn't go to college but also don't have too much of an interest in it, nor do I think it's a possible route for me now. If I were to attend college, my options would be to take 4 years off work to graduate, but I can't afford to do that (literally) as I need the income and don't want to amass massive debt (even with FAFSA). Alternatively, I can take 1-2 courses per semester while working, but then it would take me about 8-9 years to graduate. All this and getting a degree doesn't even guarantee a job (though it does help), *and* I don't even have a clue what degree I would even go for.

But today, the last day we have to submit an application for the position, my drug addict coworker came back from his vacation. He smokes weed in the parking lot daily. Constantly complains about hating his job. And he gets the promotion.

Just another aspect of my life fell apart. Another dream crushed. Another reason to pray I don't wake up in the morning when I go to sleep. There is nothing in life to look forward too. 

Work? Always falls apart. Always get pushed around. 

Friendships? Sure, I have those, but all my friends spend our time together either texting their girlfriends or bringing their girlfriends with and clinging to them the whole time.

Relationship of my own? Every girl I've dated has cheated on me. I just figure it has to be my fault somehow. 

Family? A mess of people that despise each other and drag me in the middle. I get reminded of how shitty I am by extended family regularly because I forgot a birthday. I try so hard to make these people happy, but I'm never enough.

Why should I keep trying? All my life, I was raised to respect people and be kind to everyone. I've always done my best to work hard and to make the people around me have better lives by brightening their days. I've always helped everyone I can, but I finally see that I'm not enough. 

I've gone to therapy in the past, but my therapist kept trying to convince me to find my answers in God. I'm an atheist.

I’m fortunate that a classmate whom I barely know offered the spare room at his parents’ place. God, I feel like such a burden. I just need to get back on my feet.

It got exponentially worse once I joined engineering, if you look at my transcripts and plotted a chart w.r.t my grades semester wise, you'd see my mental health taking an absolute dive, first year was acceptable grades wise, each semester it got worse to a point where by the final year all I have is passing grades. This degree has taken a major toll on me. I gave up so much to get nothing in return, in fact it say I'm in the negatives. Now that I've some how graduated with a horrible GPA and essentially worthless degree I'm in the position of job hunting, I can't will myself to get off my bed much less apply for engineering jobs that I know I'm not possibly qualified for, I feel like they'd just toss my pitiful resume in the shredder.

389,t3_diu9n5,The way I see things.,"This is a very cliche, boring and unoriginal view of things. But none the less it is a mindset that I have been stuck in for a long time, and can't seem to find a way out of.

In my eyes we as people live pointless lives, not because we will one day die but because we will never have everything we want. Never being able to afford those amazing things, never being praised by all (while these obviously are not what everyone wants it's just a general idea) so if we do not have everything and everything life has to offer; why bother?

 I understand that a world where we simply had whatever we wanted would never work, but why do we take bullshit and suffering and just become complacent with having ""enough""? 

Every day people wake up and go to some shitty job that they hate, because they have to. The work they get paid 50,000 a year for helps make the big guy at the top millions. And believe me I love capitalism, but I am a hypocrite. 

None of our opinions are ours, they all stem from outside influences that make us who we are, the essence of your being is determined by certain people, certain events and certain words. Some people do not think at all, they base their opinions on those of the masses, and actively shun and destroy any attempt to reason or present views from outside the echo chamber.

And to top it all off, after all of the shit above; when we are forced to end our existence whether we are ready or not, after years of deteriorating from a young and outgoing person to a sack of meat stuck in bed, when we eventually kick the bucket nobody will remember. Our grandchildren will be the last people to know our names, see our faces and feel our pain. Only those who have the resources to be remembered will be the makers of history.

Now, I by no means expect you to agree with me; you all perceive life in your own ways. My view is not right, nor is it wrong; but this is how I am living my life on a day by day basis. I am done, be good to each other; because nobody else will.",depression

I’ve talked to them about this all multiple times but they seem to brush it off or change only for things to go back to normal after a week or two. It’s exhausting. 

I just went through a breakup from a toxic relationship. He cheated on me and when I was with him he would be very physical with me even when I was clearly not into it. When we would be kissing he would pull himself out his pants without any notice and try to take my clothes off. Now that things are over he got a new girlfriend a week after the breakup.

I was born in early 2003 (not stating month for anonymous-embarrassment purposes) and when i was around 1 year old or maybe not quite a year old according to my family I found some sort of meth in a trashcan (according to my mom it was cotton they use to filter the tip of needles when sucking it into a syringe from a spoon?) and hours later thankfully I got to a hospital but my family was told i had meth in my system and was ""convulsing"" for 24 hours probably didnt have oxygen and shit (this story is my own version from all of the details ive heard from my family) probably wasnt going to make it and if i was I would be severely retarded in a hospital 2 hours away from my hometown (oh btw this all takes place somewhere in good ol' California where I still remain) but apparently I ended up coming out of it alive, fine and dandy like no check ups ever happened after I don't know this confuses me how I just ended up fine and apparently court / a judge sent me home to live with my aunt who I still live with to this day but that doesent really matter in this. So as I grow and get older, I was naturally skinny and small but was always told and believed one day I would grow up big and strong, so I waited year after year after year but never saw any huge drastic changes in my height or appearance in general. If you saw pictures of me you would understand. Fast forward now I am turning 17 in 5-6 months and my current height is 4'11"" and a half and I weigh about 75 lbs right now but I have been up to 105 lb before. Have not been to the doctor in 2 years, Aunt says it is a waste of time but always says she will call anyways and make an appointment but never does. Oh and the time I went 2 years ago I was a freshman and finally concerned, they told me my testosterone levels were normal (they were probably normal but NOT average ive done alot of research) and since I had peachfuzz on my pubic area and arm pits it was probably only  a matter of time before I sprout. I was not convinced but felt defeated. There are alot of details I dont mention about how horrible this is because I know people have it worse and I dont want to be a pity party attention loving type of person, I am genuinely worried because like i said 4'11"" 75 POUNDS and I look literally 12 or 13 ive heard as young as 9. Am I ever going to grow? My research ([https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Parenting-Children-Who-Have-Been-Exposed-to-Methamphetamine.pdf](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/Parenting-Children-Who-Have-Been-Exposed-to-Methamphetamine.pdf)) tells me I have a failure to thrive, (develop and grow) and ADHD and stress problems and many other things which anyone could say they have ADHD but I have genuinely showed signs my whole life of attention problems and my own aunt even mentioned ADHD to me when i was 10 saying I probably have it (she didn't think maybe its because the overdose of meth amphetamine I had when I was a young developing baby???). So what Do I do.. someone please just give me some advice.. why did this have to happen to me I feel so unlucky like I had no control over what happened and if it didnt happen I would be normal right now I would have a girlfriend and friends and CONFIDENCE that is for sure. Please help me, I have no one to talk to. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, please no harsh comments / trolls this is genuine, I apologize for my writing I know it was a bit vent-y but I don't have a lot of time to write this out.

TL;DR - When I was around 1 year old I overdosed on meth-amphetamine and now as I get older mentally and age wise but not physically I start to wonder if it effected my testosterone levels or development in general, which I have now came to the conclusion it probably did but have no idea what to do.",depression

408,t3_dil3fm,My mom found out the hard way about my porn habits.,"Yes, the title says it all. My mom walked in on me masturbating, she got very angry, but she didn't yell. I'm kinda happy that she didn't yell because then I would yell back and I can't talk as well as I want to when I'm angry.

She told me to put my phone upstairs but I refused. She didn't force me to, probably because it was night and everyone was going to sleep. But I'm especially angry because if she would LISTEN to me, then we probably wouldn't be in this uncomfortable situation.

Week after week, I asked for her to arrange an appointment with a therapist I previously visited with before. But every time, she just said that she would get in contact with them and arrange an appointment. But she's seemed to make excuses like ""they didn't answer."" Or ""I can't do that right now."" I keep asking, and Shee keeps making excuses.

I said to her, ""It's bad enough you can't get me enrolled in a school, why can't you at LEAST get me a therapist. In response to this, she made yet another excuse. I also asked if she could ask my Grandmother to get me a therapist, since she is in a better financial state. She made more excuses and I just gave up. I said to myself, ""I'll just try again in a week or two. Maybe be more persuasive."" And then a day after that, that's when she walked in on me.

Now I am extremely pissed off because she is angry at me, when she is the one who wasn't listening. She didn't bother to think, ""Oh well, maybe he has an issue that he isn't comfortable telling me about."" She didn't seem to think that at all. I'm trying to be a responsible teenager and solve my own problems and she just puts a road block right in the center of my path. She also told me to ""Ask others for help if you need it."" So when I do that and I do really need help, there is just nothing that can be done apparently. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I am of the make gender and she thinks I can handle it. Well I can handle it, but not on my own. 

My first reaction to the situation was ""Shiiiitt..."" And my second reaction was ""I guess I will type away my thoughts on Reddit."" So here I am doing just that because I have no friends to talk to about this. Or at least not friends that I trust enough yet. Strange how the internet can be good for this

I watched him die, he was sick and just two weeks before he died we learned info from the doctor that gave us hope and we thought he was going to make it.  We were gone for a week and then we got a call that we should definitely get back.  When we got back, he wasn't the same man we just saw.  He barely spoke, he couldn't move, he just stared with this really soulful look in his eyes.  Like he was half here half there.  It took days and days, he was in excruciating pain.  I had to hold him full body hug when he stood up and sat down.  I tried to get him to the bathroom one night and it took me and two uncles and he hadn't spoken in a while but he screamed take me to the hospital.  We got a hospital bed in the living room and he slept mostly.  I was standing bedside with my brother when he opened his eyes, he turned his head and he looked right at me.  He then turned to my brother and like a miracle he got the strength to life his arms and pull my brother into his chest. He wouldn't let go. He hadn't spoken or moved in days and just like a miracle we had this moment.  I'm crying just thinking about it.  We followed the signs of death packet and tried to get everything right.  We knew he was going for real on this day and we were all there. His feet turned purple, his skin turned yellow, his breaths shallow and abrupt.  It was painful to watch, I hope he wasn't really there to feel it.  He died, I watched him die.  I was already in a deep depression then and I thought that seeing that was going to light a fire under my ass.  My grandpa was about seizing the day, and he wanted me to seize it.

422,t3_diwjde,"I want to live, but i don't because i can't feel anything anymore..."," At the age of 14 (19 now) as far as i can remember i started facing the classic symptoms of depression (negative thoughts, actual sadness, anger, isolation from friends and family, some social anxiety), it took a year for it to ""wear off"" and the battle had drawn to an end. The depression was of unknown origin, my therapist and I couldn't determine a legitimate reason for it other than puberty, which i think it was given the fact that every part of my life was relatively normal. The only issue i can remember of that i had was a general lack of privacy, i desperately wanted a space of my own in order to be able to do things without anyone being there to judge the music i listened to, the books i read, the games i played and the expressions i made when i did all these things. I wanted to develop some sort of ""character"" since i knew what i wanted in life (To become a physicist). So i embarked on this ""journey"" of mine and i fell in love with math, physics, electronics and philosophy, dazzled by the beauty of science (and Carl Sagan videos on youtube xD). Everything seemed to be working like a clock and i remember the amazing experience of discovering something new each day (and being lightyears ahead of class). As time went on, my dislike of 'conforming to the current social setting' grew exponentially, due to the fact that the people around me (family, school, society?) couldn't understand my motivations and they thought that i was weird, some attempted to even bully me in school, but i had developed a mindset of ""Us and Them"" where ""Us"" stood for the set of people who could at least understand 10% of my character and had a unique goal of their own in life, now for ""Them"" was a set of SUBHUMAN people that were so brain dead that i can't even describe, these people i could identify from miles away, the way they acted/expressed themselves was no different than that of an ape, everytime you disagreed with them you could form no adequate argument because they were D.I.C.K.S, and i don't mean it in a subjective way, but an overall, actuall objective one. You could argue it's the Dunning-Krueger effect in action, but GUYS, this is some form of super-idiotism that would make even our previous ape ancestors superior to people running around the playground shouting about their football teams and believing in god fanatically. I don't blame them, even i used to be like this, but on a milder level, but moral of the story is I COULD NOT FIT IN NOR COULD I ISOLATE MYSELF AND THEN COME OUT SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT PEOPLE. It was frustrating, and i even started to believe that this evolution of myself was to my detriment. I had ZERO options, there is no library nearby, no quiet place to study and relax, no means of transportation, nothing, i searched like crazy and the closest to private or quiet i could find was the bathroom. I live in a semi-industrial region and there are no ""Us"" people, period, i TRIED MY BEST to get out there and make some ""friends"" which were then consumed by this monster of medievalism and then once again i would wind up on my own. The only people i could really sympathise with were my teachers, i would venture into conversations about science, philosophical stuff, and even how i felt about the situation. All this was frustrating and all, but there was this glimmer of hope far ahead ,UNIVERSITY, YES now we're talkin', it basically kept me sane as i tried harder and harder to enforce and protect my character from being negatively affected. But then unfortunately! something so sickening, disgusting, repulsively outrageous happened that confused me to the point i couldn't handle it anymore, it was an Epstein-Barr virus infection which then led to fatigue--&gt;immune dysfunction--&gt;mononucleosis--&gt;more fatigue--&gt;back to 90% normal. I just didn't feel right, i was eating an ultra healthy diet, exercising both mind and body, and being overall healthy, but that wouldn't cut it. My emotions were perfectly in place, i was moving at a bit slower pace in life, but i could manage, then it got worse and worse and WORSE, and i was CONFUSED and ALARMED, so i went to the doctor, got diagnosed with active EBV, but no mono yet, so i thought that my fatigue was part infection and part some health mistake i was making. In the middle of all this clusterfuck i finally got mono on may 15 (2018) which lasted for 3 months, and my brain went SHUT, no sadness, no &lt;true&gt; joy, no desires, I FELT AND STILL FEEL TO THIS DAY LIKE A ROBOT. I have problems with concentration because i don't really care about what i'm concentrating on, there are no 'motivaroty' feelings to be found, i don't really enjoy doing anything EVEN science,math,physics or reading or playing video games or memes. Everything i do i do because ""It's the right thing to do"" based on the blueprints of my previously full-of-emotion mind, i know for a fact that to move on in life, i now HAVE TO do all these things, and that was the point where i got REALLY concerned about my mental health. My character still seems to be constant last time i checked, but i cannot find a reason to live really, all this i do because i know for a fact that one day will come when i will no longer be like this, and if i don't do anything productive right now, then i will suffer, and i remember how horrible suffering felt like since i've been through depression in the past. When i got into uni, things were different... i remember how amazing it felt to be surrounded by like-minded people, but now i don't seem to understand these feelings anymore, i'm confused and i don't get it. My grandma dies, my face is blank, then i remember something funny and i laugh in the midst of the funeral, i didn't feel sad, i felt a small tiny bit of comedy there but the laugh was just a reaction that a person would make in THAT funny situation i'm imagining, so basically i don't feel like i'm even alive, i don't feel like i'm here typing this right now. I don't even know what to do, i've tried going to the psychiatrist, but then i lose my concern over my own issues because i don't even care anymore, I DON'T CARE IF I DON'T CARE ANYMORE, i decided to go to the psychiatrist, my concious part decided this because of an anomaly in the levels of interest i had in life, so i went there, but i didn't want to go there, but i actually did?? I'm so confused that random thoughts have started running in my head that have nothing to do with me. I would imagine dull memories of the recent past of me walking down the hallways of the university building, i don't know why or how this thought popped up, i didn't decide it, i didn't mold it, BUT I ACTUALLY DID. It sort of seems like my mind revolted against me and has now decided to make me conform to the crowd i was talking about but i'm not even sure about that. My newfound friends in uni are still there, because apparently i haven't changed at all, i express myself according to the social environment i'm in, this mind, IT ADAPTS TO EVERYTHING, i can pretend to be dumb in order to socialize with dumb people, i can do things i would not ever imagine doing because i don't care anymore, why would i ever talk about religion, why would i ever hang out with these people, why would i ever sit still doing absolutely nothing but watching each thought as it passes me by without feeling anything, i try to stop some of these 'intrusive' thoughts but then i think to myself ""why?"", well because they do not match up with who i am obviously, but that reason alone can't satisfy the need to stop the thought and get back to normal thinking, so i stop caring even about my mental state then!!@# I don't have control over anything, i can't, i've given up, i've raised my arms to the fucking sky along with the psychiatrists who say that i'm 'just depressed' and throw those meds at me, they don't work and make my stomach feel like operation flaming fart. The only reason i'm alive is because my feelings seem to respond to music, give me any kind of music and i'll probably tell you that i ACTUALLY LIKED IT because it created a well-directed array of feelings in me, music seems to be the only thing where i can say with certainty that I LIKE THIS ONE, or, I GIVE IT A 1/10. You might have noticed up to this point that i tend to make jokes here and there, but that doesn't reinforce the fact that i really feel comedy, it's like a PARADOX. I don't want to live anymore, I don't want to commit suicide, but i kind of do? Maybe i'm depressed again? Maybe i'm ill somehow?

It seems to be that I cannot cope with separation, and in part, I disconnect myself from everyone once I am alone so I don't have to think about being apart from anyone. This has caused much strain on my relationship and mental health, and I am no longer in a relationship because of it.

I caused arguments out of seemingly nowhere, or blew things out of proportion. I made my partner feel worse, and made myself feel worse because of it. I have an abusive past, and some things I cannot control, but that doesn't excuse how I acted or what I said. I am a terrible, toxic person when it all comes down to it. And I think I'm not able to be in a relationship. No matter how much I love the person, I'm too difficult to handle. Even for me..

I love him, and I will for a long time, but he deserves way better than me. He deserves someone worth loving, and worth his time. I hope he finds that. I really do..

Whereas I'll just stay in my room and go recluse again like I always do.. Or worse.. Who even cares anymore..

427,t3_dimra0,"After what is currently going on with my life, I realise cutting all my relationships and blow my head to bits is a good idea.","The last few months had been the worst time in my life. The initial stages of my depression or what the symptoms I started to feel was during my board exams - my girlfriend of whom I thought about being mine for 8 years and in relationship for 2 years broke up with me, saying I don’t have the standards and am too immature to be in a relationship with her. 

This in turn came all of a sudden and traumatic way, which resulted from me usually getting good results to end up with barely passing grades to apply in universities I preferred to join. 

I was and am the most jolly person in my group, always tried to put a smile on everyone’s faces I meet, and still tried to hide my sorrows so I don’t make anyone else feel depressed or feel the same way I did. I made myself affirm that I don’t need medications or therapy I will surely get better anytime soon and live a better life. I started to play volleyball again and hoped for the best to stay alive. 

After 2 months I forced myself to move on and I started dating someone new and it was going great, but after a few dates spanned for a few months — it feels like she lost interest in me. I tried my utmost best to be there for her cause I have been in the same shoes as she did get cheated on and I feel the same feeling seeing my ex getting into a relationship the next day we broke up. 

My date tried committing suicide by overdosing on pills last night, and I tried to assure her she’s too precious to lose her life and in return she told me she don’t deserve me and her baggage of sorrows to deal with it. She survived but she’s kept me on ignored list. 

I stayed up all night waiting for her to reply back and in the mean time I realised my parents, my friends, or my partners that I had - don’t care really about the guy who looks happy and stupid     


Am I really incompetent to be with them? 

Am I not special? 

Am I only gonna provide a shoulder to cry on when someone’s going through their worst while they just think I am talking bullshit when I talk about my sadness cause I am not like this? Am I not a person to care about when I am trying to give a damn about them? I have feelings too — but just overlooked.

428,t3_dit5dk,I have zero interest in class and exam and wanna skip?,"Let me give a little background...I wasn't a bright student in school. Somehow passed the entrance exam to get a college degree. Took a degree which i thought was good for me. Failed in the second year as i thought this subject had no value, goddamn this entire subject was replaced by an algorithm. Professors didn't give a shit about students. My parents somehow convinced me to take the classes for the subjects i failed. Let me tell you i had no interest in any of those classes. I didn't go to college for 2 weeks coz i felt like shit. Made a fake medical certificate just in case. Went to classes just in case so i know about what's happening in class. Tomorrow i have two exams, haven't studied for shit, i feel like i should skip, i hate going through these subjects. Parents don't even understand what I'm talking about. They tell me study for the shit tomorrow and prepare. They're more concerned about other people's opinions. As for me i thought about doing my own startup as a college degree was useless, found out that someone else had made it. My friend who works with me is a douchebag. He's a kind of rich kid who you wanna punch to death. Motherfucker tells me I'm the reason he's having a bad time,inspite him being a lazy ass. Only thing is that he's got an internship at pretty good place which i literally don't. I wanna try out ways to make money but the dread of going to class and taking an exam and the tension just kills my day. It went so bad that i started sleeping once in every 2 days. Forget taking bath or brushing your teeth, those things happened in like once every 3-4 days. My life literally feels like shit. What should I do? I'll elaborate more if you wanna know.

429,t3_diwejo,Finally starting to deal with my issues,"Semi-rant, I'd just like to share for some reason. 

For over 10 years, I've had an eating disorder, depression, anxiety attacks, dissociation strong enough to be called a disorder, suicidal thoughts that haven't been realized primarily because I was too stubborn to actually leave. And a bunch of smaller related problems.

Most of that time, I didn't even realize that I had any issue. I just considered myself generally sad, picky... along those lines. 

For what it's worth, I've finally figured out what is wrong and that I am not able to deal with this on my own without any medication. So I'm going to a therapist this week, and even though I'm a bit nervous about that, I'm also super excited that I might finally be able to be honestly happy again.

I can feel happiness sometimes, but I never feel truly happy. I recently lost 1 of my best friends (they're not dead, but they're just not friends with me anymore), and another one of my friends is starting to slowly fade away. We've been friends since Kindergarten, so it's a big loss for me. I recently broke a pretty expensive computer I bought, and some other personal things have made me feel sad recently.

But at the same time, I have a lot to feel happy about. I have a (relatively) successful career, both of my parents are still still with me, I've made lots of new friends at work, and I'm due for a performance review soon (one in which I may receive a promotion for depending on my performance), and I have a good life.

Also, I'm bullied at school, today i was kicked by my bullies so hard, that i couldn't catch a breath for a while. Yesterday i was suffocated by them and a week ago they were extinguishing cigarettes on my skin... I'm tired of this

439,t3_diw603,I’m so sick of being tired and lonely!,"I’m so sick of being tired literally all the time. It’s one of the reasons I’m certain I have depression, despite not being professionally diagnosed. I’m exhausted no matter how much sleep I get. I could get a full eight hours sleep by some miracle, and still take a nap in the afternoon because I’m worn out. And I could literally have done NOTHING that day and it makes no difference. Of course I can’t talk to anyone about it because they either call me lazy or wand to preach to me about how they feel and what helps them.

Second, I’m sick of being lonely all the time. All I can do is fantasize about having real friends or being in a relationship because nobody wants that with me in real life. I’m the one everyone gets tired of after awhile. Yeah we’ll be friends for a couple months or less but then they sick of me and abandon me. And no matter how much I pretend to like I’m worthy in my head the harsh reality is this, I’m not special, I’m not important, I’m not unique in a good way, I’m not talented, and I NEVER will be. All that crap people spout about you being “amazing” just being you, only counts if you’re rich/famous or both. And even if I ever do by some chance end up being so, I still won’t be happy. It’ll never be enough. What I do now isn’t even enough for most people. I know they’re all talking about me behind my back, wondering why I don’t do more now that I’ve graduated from high school. Wondering why I don’t have my license yet even though I’m about to be in driving school. Nothing I do matters and I’m tired of even trying. 

I’m sick of being exhausted and I’m sick of being so lonely. But whatever. Just because I’m getting older clearly doesn’t mean that’s magically gonna change. If anything it’s probably just gonna get worse.",depression

446,t3_dist0y,"My mind wants to leave me, but I don't want it to.","  I really don't know where to begin.  I'm a 42 year old man.  I have been with my wife for over twenty years and have four kids that I love desperately and would give my life for.  
     In recent years the amount of stress in my life has multiplied, and it's taken my mind into dark corners.  I do contract work in an industry that is notoriously unstable, oil and gas.  Got in trouble with the taxman early on out of sheer stupidity, worked like a mad man and recovered. And have continued to work like a mad man and done things better to not piss off uncle Sam again. Three years later I have paid 3 years of college for my daughter, managed to put money in IRAs and have a little in savings. I am not wealthy by any stretch of the imagination, just saved a little. By definition a small success, but one that came with daily amounts of stress and worrying, plus 70+ hour weeks that have taken their toll on me. Little sleep, little rest, always tired.   Things that I fear have altered my mind somehow.
      As the business is turning down, almost to the point of stopping, I have found that the only value I feel I have is as a provider. And the possibility of not being able to provide paralyzes me with fear and anxiety.  I don't know who I am if I'm not that. I feel I don't know who I am at all.  That I don't know how to live.  I have no happiness and no joy in life.  The future looks dark.  I can best describe my Outlook by saying I want to live to see my kids on their way, after which I will lie down and rest and if I don't get up anymore, it's ok.  I have come to understand that some of us men take our provider roles serious to almost the point of death. . I say this because I had always questioned why so many men chose a way out, or worse, took their loved ones with them, while having a better life than many. And I'm sad to say I kinda understand now.  And that scares me.  I'm not suicidal. I would never hurt those that I love. But I definitely understand what that desperation feels like.  I know that if I continue to put one foot in front of the other a different time will come. Maybe even better.  But how do you move while imobilized by fear. I have fallen into a state of darkness that I don't want to live in.  I want to continue fighting like i always have.  But my mind says otherwise. I only work, sleep and worry.  I have no social circle.  And loneliness has always been a constant companion.
      I drive a truck for a living. I am not an educated man, so my opportunities going forward will always be limited.

448,t3_dihl6n,I think about suicide every day.,"Long story short, I've been a mess since grade school. I've always felt different and out of place in this world. I grew up in an extremely dysfunctional setting. It's just mostly been bad experience after bad experience, with some occasional good times sprinkled in here and there. I was sexually perverted as a child, and could never pinpoint the source of perversion, as there were multiple possibilities. And as a child I perpetuated that perversion unto others. It's caused a lot of traumatic mental anguish in myself, in my family and others.
I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD as young as 9. I was on prescriptions for Ritalin and Zoloft before I was even 10. 
I'm 28 now. I have a girlfriend. I have a much better relationship with my mother these days. I have a daughter who is now as old as I was when I was diagnosed. A daughter that I promised (before she could understand the words I promised) that I wouldn't ever leave her through suicide. I promised her because I was scared I would go through with it eventually, had I not. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 years, also thanks to my daughter, who at 6 told me to quit. She's a blessing.

But... everyday. Guaranteed almost. I think of ending it. Or just think of it ending on it's own. Some nights I fall asleep, hoping I don't wake up. Sometimes when I drive, I have the impulse to jerk the wheel and drive into my own demise. Somtimes I tell ""god"" to just take me out. Even though I stopped believing in him before Santa. I pray for aneurysms. For heart attacks. It's terrifying living with these thoughts. And it depresses me even more when people like my girlfriend try their best to help me, but can't do anything for me. 

I feel beyond the help of other people, therapists included. I feel the tides of my depression pulling me out past the buoys of my peers and support systems. It's a starless night, over these cold deep waters. I'm paddling my arms and legs. But the undertow pulls at me. The odds feel stacked.

I’m a 23 year old guy living a pretty normal life and I honestly don’t know what’s the problem with me, I just feel so sad and empty all the time, and for the past few months it has affected my work, daily life and the relationships I have with others. I can’t even force myself to do anything productive or to sit down and learn new things, something I used to love. In my own eyes, I’m pretty successful as far as financial situation goes, that’s the biggest thing I ever wanted really, to have enough money so I wouldn’t have to worry about it every single day. Although, since I've achieved that dream of mine, everything started going downhill. I realised that there is more to life than money, so I realised I needed to get into a relationship, so I did. That didn't go well. I found a partner just for the reason to have one and obviously along the way I realised that this is not the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I also thought that surrounding myself with people would make me feel better, so I did. I have quite a few friends right now, but spending time with them feels even more lonely than when I'm actually alone. Even though I feel lonely around my friends, I desperately need to be accepted, I stress so bad when I think I've done something wrong or made them feel bad. I also started to envy a few of my guy friends that are able to feel more relaxed around girls, or in general, this sparks a lot of anxiety in me. If a roommate of mine goes on a date with a girl, I instantly get envious and start to worry and the anxiety kicks in. I get insanely jealous and the more I do it, the more I push myself into this box of worries, anxiety and fear. I don't know what I want from life anymore, nothing gives me joy. I fear it might be depression, sure seems like it. I feel anxious most of the time, even when I'm alone. I can speak to strangers, but it goes to a certain point when I simply get too tired from talking. I feel like it's not me that's talking to them, but the idea of this social and likeable person I try to act out. I want to be normal. I want to enjoy and appreciate the things that I have. I want to find happiness in the little things again. I want to be motivated. I want to stop looking at every new female friend as a potential girlfriend, simply due to the fact that I'm so lonely. I want to stop acting happy and actually be happy. I want to talk to someone I can trust, but how can I do that when I don't trust anyone but myself? I just can't hold everything I have inside of me, I'm afraid that one day it'll just blow up and it'll be the end of it and I won't be able to get back up.

Then, I was watching a show that I dont even like and the main character spoke about her eating habits and her mentor was really concerned and it struck a chord. I suffer from the same eating disorder that the character in the show does and it triggered me in a sudden and scary way.

Writing everything down made me feel so much better.
Nothing has, in fact, changed but writing made me feel like I wasn't an impostor, since I often feel like I'm not ""depressed"" enough or those kinds of shits... It gave me more strength.

I searched for a college I'm interested in, started drawing for my portfolio and...

Felt actual hope.

It is such an odd feeling, really. I feel like it just gave me super powers.
If I want, I can.

Long story short, everyone has it's own experience. I'll probably come back in a few days with the darkest thoughts but, for now... I feel like I've found my way to deal with it.
Try to experience stuffs and maybe you will find yours.

But don’t get me wrong, it’s not suicidal ideation, it actually makes me appreciate my life a bit more. Some scenes:  Waiting at the tram stop, I imagine how my body would get crushed if I had just kept walking. After re-watching season 1 of Fargo I became extra cautious handling objects with my hands, out of fear I may accidentally hit my skull and crush it somehow, and then think of the stupid mistake I made moments before I died. I was on the tram the other day, suddenly I imagined all the people around me aging rapidly. I looked at my reflection on the door, and tried to imagine it for myself, I looked lifeless, just really plain. Tbh I don’t think I would want to live till old age, but I don’t want to die from a freak accident either, which isn’t in my control but whatevs. I generally have these thoughts when I get really stressed.  it kinda reminds me of how short a gap there is between living and not living. In a strange way it makes all other worries-family, work, social life, education, seem just not worth it to stress over to the point of not living with self-satisfaction. So put simply, whenever I feel I’m not living up to my “full potential”. I imagine a scenario that can take place in that very moment in which I can die. And that makes me think that there is no “potential” I can live up to, it’s just this imaginary theory I have in my head of myself. The thought of  it calms me in a way.

The deepest moments of depression when i am close to death and non-existence felt greater than anything i have ever lived before, it isn't happiness or sadness, it's something i wouldn't even be able to describe with words (well maybe one: Serenity)

If not that, i had prior to that very violent thoughts, i idolized 2 kids who did horrible things (Eric Harris &amp; Dylan Klebold , the Shooters of Columbine), and now i was able to get past those, but that made me want to kill myself even more.

I have literally no good thing to say about myself, i'm an antisocial fuck, that has no qualities.

The only quality i rarely heard from others is that ""I'm smart"", whether they mean it or not, they never tell me why i'm smart, or in what field.

I have planned to kill myself on my birthday (30th of October) and since that decision, i have been enjoying life more, cherishing these last moments.

I might be able to not do it, but i have so many problems, i don't know where to start, If i can EVEN start.

487,t3_dirb7r,I need help,"Everyone calls me what my username is, so sweety is what I will use in case I need to refer to myself.
I am 17, my real name is Alexandru, but I feel like my mom is talking to me when people use my real name because I am just so used to people calling me ""Sweety"". There is a backstory behind that nickname, but I will try not to get into it since its a long story. Short version: I make compromises for everyone and always support everyone around me both emotionally and sometimes more directly witch makes me ""sweet"".
Also, apologies for my bad english since I am Romanian and pretty drunk right now.
I guess I'll be telling you my whole story so if you dont want to bother reading all of it im ok with that. I just finally decided to try and get help, even if its from random redditors.
I lived a pretty happy and normal childhood by romanian standards. The usual ""stole some candy bars and coke cans"" and sometimes getting in trouble. My parents were ok, but I rarely ever saw my dad since he was working abroad most of the time. The only interesting parts are when I (for some reason) tortured and ""experimented"" on animals and insects I could find around town. Basically murdered many rats in awfully creative ways and trapped insects in boxes with spider so I could see how the spiders killed them. I would get bitten by not-so-venomous-but-painful spiders a lot. Once my mom found out about my hobbies, she wasnt too concerned. Just wanted me to stop before I got bitten by a black widow and died. The other intetesting part is the ""leadership"" one I guess. I would get into a lot of fights with my friends and peers. I think this was because my bigger brother abused me everyday, locking me in the bathroom, burning me with cigars and beating me senseless for most of my early years. Whenever my mom asked me why I was bruised, I would invent excuses until one day when he beat me so hard, most of my teeth got ""removed"". I had to wear braces later on because of that one fight. As in sexual behaviors, I found out about masturbation when I was like 7-8 but not much in terms of fetishes or anything. Aww shitz, drunk me forgot about the interesting part. This will sound like its pulled straight out of some cartoon show. At age 12 I sorta organised a militia against some dudes who didnt like us playing hide and seek in their construction site. We were just 7 kids who kept throwing fireworks at them to annoy them, but eventually the cops got involved so we had to stop.
In my early teenage years, I was a loner. My daily life was really shit. At age 13 I got into boxing, after a while I got kicked out of the team. At least now my brother stopped abusing me after I tested my new learned skills on him. But this was actually really sad for me and perhaps the first time I had to deal with some sort sadness or even depression. I always dreamt of being a boxer. Getting kicked out ruined 13 year old me to the core.
For the most part, until the age of 15, I was still a loner. Thats when I started getting into partying and alchohol and drugs. For 9 months I was doing a homemade drug almost daily. Eventually, when I turned 16, my mother got diagnosed with a heart disease and I just couldnt do the drug anymore. (In case you are wondering, the drug was a mix of bug spray and battery acid sprayed on tobacco and it was very VERY strong, americans might call it ""spice"") I just quit, and yeah, it sucked. The withdrawal was literally painful for like 2 weeks.
Shortly after, I turned 16. Nothing interesting happened until I moved in with my benchmate witch we will call ""M"". I cant say ive got along with her, but she was a good friend to me and tried to understand me. I wasnt used to people really caring about me, so I would often push her away, thinking she just wanted to manipulate me or some other paranoid shit. After a while I became somewhat suicidal. I started drinking like a lot. And I mean A LOT. I didnt worry much about it, but was very much aware that I was a little addicted from past experience with the spice. This was around the time when I first started becoming ""sweet"". I realised helping people was something that made me feel good. I liked to think I was good at it and I probably was. I can say I did a lot of good during that time, but I kept my own issues bottled up, witch was a big mistake. I still dont know why, but at the time I really wanted to die. Probably because I was trying to help everyone, spreading myself thin and feeling like shit when I inevitably failed sometimes. This chapter is really weird. It all started with a cough and a week later, the cough got much worse. A week after that, I first coughed up blood. I just stared into my palm and I was weirdly glad about it. I kept on going for a few weeks without telling anyone about my problem, until one day when I coughed up a literal puddle of blood in front of some of my friends. I went to the doctor and found out I had some rare lung infection common with people who have damaged lungs. The only explanation for this was my past inhalant and homemade drug abuse witch must have damaged my lungs to the point of contracting this rare, antibiotic resistant infection. I was still a drinker so of course, the medication wouldnt work. But then, M found out and she, unlike my friends, showed actual concern and feeling. My friends were concerned too, but they just didnt show it as much, joking about it and calling me ""black lung"" instead of ""sweety"". My illness was no longer a secret and I started caring about myself when M did. She helped me at the time a lot more than she realises maybe to this day. Eventually, the infection sort of faded, I guess. I really wanted to and genuinely tought I was going to die. Somehow I lived and was ok, despite the permanent bronchial damage.
After my ""survival"", nothing interesting happened, just a lot more bonding between me and M. Shortly after I turned 17, we got togheter. At first I didnt have much feeling for her besides our bond. In the 2 months we were together, I realised how sad I actually was up to this point. I never loved anyone, never felt close to anyone, never had someone care for me the way she did and for the first time in a long while, I was happy. Whenever I saw her smiling, I felt better than I ever felt helping those poor sods who depended on me. Despite my unending happiness, I was still an alcoholic and I confessed to her about my drinking. She tried her best to help me, but I just didnt manage to quit. She eventually broke up with me, it wasnt just about my alcoholism, but thats a whole other story.
Thats where Im at now, after being with M I tried finding that same affection in many people. People witch I probably let down. I had some days-long things with some girls that just couldnt work out, hell, I am so desperate I even tried a long distance thing. But like most of everyone, they leave. I know there is something wrong with me. So now I turned back to helping everyone just to feel better about myself. I cant stand being alone, I just want someone and this sounds so cringey and I know!!
I am currently having an early lung infection once again, but this time it might be really bad. And despite knowing I might die, I smoke and drink like always. I dont know if i miss M, I dont think I do, but I just aint happy and being with her made me realise, that I love loving someone. I wanna die, but at the same time, I want a reason to live. What do?
Sorry for all the trivia, perhaps all the backstory wasnt necessary, but I just felt like venting all of it.

490,t3_dicz20,"If you have friends who are struggling with depression, help them with their situation instead of giving them “hallmark card” comments!","Many of us who have struggled with depression have struggled for many reasons.

Often times, you get those bullshit comments like “just gotta think highly of yourself” or “get out of your head” or “you gotta love yourself more” (my least fucking favorite one).

So if you’re a friend of someone with depression or have depression, just help them out or tell your friend to help you to resolve those issues!!

So if your depressed friend have body image issues, go to the gym with them! Start a diet plan with them! Be there for them!

Is your friend having trouble with careers? Well help them look for jobs! Ask other people for them. Do homework together if you guys are in school. Hang out at their house while they’re maybe studying or trying to learn a new skill like coding or web design or whatever.

Are they having trouble finding a guy or girl? Then be their wingman!!! Go WITH them to clubs or bars or social events and help them out.

Your words don’t help!! Many of us have issues that we feel like we can’t resolve so we are depressed. So if you REALLY want to help your friend, help them through your actions! NOT words!

Even if your friend doesn’t think they are motivated, just hanging out with them and slowly pushing them to do something can help. Or maybe suggest it on your own. “Hey I’m going to the gym, come with me!”",depression

Hi, I’m 15 (f) and I need help but I’m too afraid to tell someone what I’m going through. I’m not diagnosed with any mental illnesses but I think I have depression. 

Since about December 2018 I’ve been feeling like absolute shit. It started of with me starving myself then In like February i started binge eating. I gained so much weight which made my self esteem so bad  and made me so insecure. Since March I haven’t shown my skin once or worn a t-shirt or shorts and it’s killing me. My school started in February as well which made things even worse. I’ve never enjoyed school but this year (grade 9) has been the worst year of life. I also got a new job in feb which has really took a tole on me. 

Everyday I cry whether it be on the bus to school or as a procrastinate on my phone at 2am. It’s never for a certain reason I can’t control my self.

In about June I moved friend groups from a popular group to a group with some of my class friends. I thought this was going to be a good change in my life but I don’t really like them anymore than my other group. My best friend attends another school near me so the only time I get to see her is on the weekends. 

I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to kill myself I just wish I could not live in my life right now. Last month self harmed pretty bad and it left really obvious marks. It’s getting hot in Australia (we r in spring) and the one thing I want to do is where a short sleeve top for the first time this year but I’m too afraid of what someone will say when they see my cuts. 

I wish I didn’t go to school because I do nothing. I don’t participate In sport and class because I literally can’t. I struggle so hard to be engaged like I feel so dumb. My grades have dropped from A’s and B’s to C’s, D’s and E’s because I don’t submit any assignments.

I work way too much aswell (20-30 hours a week) which is why every single teacher thinks I’m failing... not because I’m not okay. I don’t know why I’m so obsessed with working. The money doesn’t even make me happy, it’s just sitting in my bank account. 

All my friends are all so jealous of my money and constantly ask how much I have with annoys me so bad. 

Since about August I’m been so mad. Like I’m just always in a shitty mood. I snap and people truely don’t mean it for no reason. I’m rude to teachers when they don’t deserve it and struggle saying anything nice.

508,t3_diqffm,Achieved my Dream of Living in Japan...but my Mental Health Ruined it.,"I'm posting this because I can't find the answer or understand why it all came crashing down. I guess some background information on myself. I have a family history of anxiety and depression; naturally, it's been passed on to me. I struggled with extreme Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety throughout my high school and university years. I never tried to improve myself until 2012/2013 when I had enough of the shit I was going through and decided to backpack across central Japan, alone, without anyone holding my hand, for the first time in my life. What an experience it was. 

Being alone for that month opened my eyes to how big the world really was; however, when I returned home, I felt like it was all over: my dream was accomplished and it was time to move on with my life. I had a huge breakdown around New Year's (for the better), and from then on, I really changed my outlook on life. I helped my family more, improved myself self-confidence, and built up the resilience--albeit for a short time--to deal with the shit in my life. I vowed that after I finished my time in university that I would teach English in Japan. I started studying Japanese seriously, my depression declined, and once again planned a trip to Tokyo in 2016. During that time however, I realized the impact my anti-depressants were having on my body and decided, by my own volition, to ween myself off of them. From the all the stress from university, I had a major breakdown once again, but this time the culprit was more anxiety than depression. I conceded to the fact that I have to be on this medication for the rest of my life to cope with anxiety. On the positive side, I developed coping mechanisms I still use to this day, and broke through that tough time in my life.   


May 2018, I received news from the JET Programme of Canada that I was hired to teach English in Japan. I was ecstatic! With 3 degrees in hand, being a qualified English teacher among them, I was ready to take this major step in my life and live outside of Canada for more than one year. Everything went smoothly. I moved to Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan and began teaching English to elementary school children in 5 separate schools. Naturally, culture shock set in, but I dealt with it accordingly. However, something nastier was laying underneath. Throughout the year, I became bitter with the school system there, Japanese teachers' treatment of us English teachers, the kids' lack of care of English (due to the teachers' attitudes), and general confused feelings of ""why am I even here?"" I came to figure out that Iwaki had some of the lowest academic scores in all of Japan, and teachers in that area were generally shit teachers that only cared about following rules instead of actually teaching and having an impact on their students. To clarify, I was doing their jobs for them: I was teaching English IN Japanese to a majority of kids that didn't care. Maybe I took my job too seriously, but I PUT IN the effort to LEARN Japanese, and the effort to connect with these kids. Throughout this one year, I did make amazing friends, joined a local Iwakian folk group, traveled a bit, and did have a handful of amazing teachers I taught with. Unfortunately, this wasn't enough. It was just too much.  


My frustration and anger towards Japanese society boiled to the point, where in early August of this year, one night, I got extremely drunk, vandalized a handful of places, and almost threw myself into oncoming traffic. Although I had friends, I felt ""lonely""; as if my existence there meant nothing to anyone. I was anxiety ridden. I couldn't function. I couldn't eat. I felt trapped. I decided to break contract and come home before my love of Japan turned to absolute hate and despise. I don't regret this decision; however, I am extremely sour that my mental health has once again ruined a greater potential experience in my life. I think this came to be, because for the first time in my life, I recognized that I'M NOT THE PROBLEM. In the past, I always used to blame myself for shit that wasn't my fault, and I've always done the best I've could to better myself. So this had to happen.  


Now I'm back home in Canada, applying to school boards and getting on my feet once again...But I'm starting to miss Japan. I go to Japan and I miss Canada; I come home to Canada and miss Japan. I don't understand why I feel like this. I feel stuck between two different worlds. I'm sick of going through this every handful of years. I'm sick of this fucking anxiety and depression ruining everything I've worked so goddamn hard for. I'm sick of it governing my life. I'm sick of not knowing what the actual fuck to do with it. I feel fucking lost with no vision of future happiness or satisfaction. I don't know what to do anymore.",depression

A few months had past, I went to college and lost contact to my friends. My college was in a different city, so I was able to put myself in a perfect solitude. 
I spent a year or two before realizing what I’m experiencing. My goal in college was to not completely fail until I shake my depression off. I’m a senior student now and I feel like I wasted a lot of time. My college is known for being very stressful, but thankfully, I held on to it. I thought stress would benefit me in my depression. 


One of the things I thought that would help is making new friends that I feel comfortable around and feel like myself. But I never succeeded. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Probably not getting out of my comfort zone often enough.

515,t3_ditepj,Money is tight and I do not know what to do. I want to be someone more and life is hitting me hard.,"Hello everyone,

I am retaking a year of University, and though I am thankful for the chance I am getting evermore stressed out. I took up piano in June with my younger brother's piano teacher, and though I love the instrument the lessons cost a lot (£22.50 an hour). Last year I was soft-nexted from one of my part-time jobs (hospitality at a horse-racing course) and fired from my other one at a football stadium doing the same thing due to a false accusation of sexual assault. Management basically covering their own ass. On that note, a lot of the management work at both locations so chances are that is why I have never been asked back to the racecourse. 

I need to make this year at Uni work; I get no other chances. After paying the rent for my Uni accommodation I only have around £900 to last me until December. Only issue is that various expenses and things I needed to pay off (e.g. credit card bill for food shopping etc. - I actually hate having a credit card, only got it because my mother said I needed to build up a credit score) I am now down to £300. With a lesson a week that comes to £90 a month, then I have to factor in food shopping etc. My parents say they will only support me financially if I am looking for a part-time job, but I freaking hate the thought of working for a wage from someone else at a pittance an hour. I am trying to write a book, build myself, smash my studies and get back up from depression and working for someone else in a crappy job like retail or a restaurant will get in the way of all of that. Working for a manager who does not care, all of that lark.  

Classical music is one of the few things that has helped me feel something in my darkest moments of depression; starting to learn it was so fulfilling, yet it looks like I will have to give it up just as I am getting started. I feel sick, angry and sad all at once. I've felt powerless for so long that now I am getting back up I am absolutely loathe to give away any of my time for a fraction of what it is truly worth. I have a talent for writing and the manuscript I have done so far has gotten really good reviews from both family/friends and an academic at the University (it is a historical fiction novel). I am cutting back on food expenses and everything else, but I am still going down the pan as far as finances are concerned. It is making feel anxious, depressed, powerless and alone.",depression

I had a huge learning disability so I didn't do all that well with school. I always struggled a lot. I was going through abuse as well for the longest time. Over 20+ years. And because of that, I developed depression, suicidal intentions, PTSD and anxiety. I didn't know I had developed all of this but I was showing signs at the age of  11. Among dealing with things at home, I was not ever social. I went to sunday school and youth group two times a week. I went on multiple retreats. And I never told my church friends what was happening....I was home schooled til 16 by my foster mother so I didn't interact with kids my own age. Frustration and rage was a common thing I saw everyday. If I made a mistake, I'd spend all day getting punished. I would spend every day from 8 am to 8 pm doing school work....Even after going to my first actual public school at 16. I learned to make friends and I learned I could lose them very quickly. My sunday school friends I had to leave behind because my foster dad was the pastor at the church decided he didn't want to preach anymore. So one day I got up and got dressed to go to church and waited for my dad, mom and brother to get ready. And my dad got up and said, ""We're not going to church anymore.

539,t3_dihupu,People cannot survive forever without happiness.,"It's like food, or water, or air. You need it. You can't go forever without it, you can't. Your heart might beat fine, your lungs will keep breathing just like normal, but if you don't get any happiness at all, your mind will start eating itself alive. It has to. It's the only way.

You might find yourself, thinking often about the past. Your memories are to your mind's need for happiness, what your fat reserves are to your body's need for food. But, it can't last forever. Eventually those memories stop being so happy, eventually they become tragic. They turn to poison in your head.

Your mind does what it can to save itself. It bounces, from epiphany to epiphany to try and make sense of a life without the one thing that makes life actually worth living. You ride the high moments, sure that you've finally found that thing that will make it all make sense, but in truth it's your mind running on fumes. Desperately trying to do more with less, until less dries up into nothing.

Eventually you just, go through the motions. Your mind makes you do the things that should make you happy, you take walks, do activities you used to find fun, but it's just your mind, spinning its wheels. And you can see normal functions of your human existence start to shut down.

Soon, you can't remember things right. You can't do things you used to be able to, like some sort of infectious incompetence has drilled into your soul. Little things break you, your mind doesn't have the strength to fight them off. As a result, losing your keys is like losing an arm. People start to notice,that you're not entirely present. They talk to you, but there's always some delay in you replying. Eventually, you can't even really feel emotions anymore. Without happiness to contrast against sadness, your body doesn't know what to do with how its feeling. You can't cry when you're sad, because to your mind, sad is the new normal.

Finally, you kinda, just stop. Routine is usually enough to keep someone going for quite awhile, but inside, there's nothing. Just hopelessness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean this to be sad, but I just think, so much of the bullshit just comes from a lack of happiness. Just like, something on the weekend, to look forward to. A show you really like can do it, or a date on Saturday, these things can keep someone going for a while. I used to be in a spot where I wasn't happy all the time, but I had gotten really good at stretching what happiness I did have to last me quite awhile. But those days are gone, and there's been nothing more terrifying than watching me destroy myself, trying to wring every last drop of happiness from my existence until it's just dry, and I'm nothing. It's like feeling your soul rot. It's terrible.

I remember my gran having a conversation about my mum going wondering when I was a baby, and there was a period where my dads work saw him leave my mum to look after the two of us when I was a baby. A perfectly healthy mum would struggle so I sometimes wonder how my mum handled it all.

On top of that our holidays and free time when I got older was always a disaster. Holidays away would always make my mum's bipolar flair up and cause issues and arguments. If I'm being honest I always had a level of trepidation when holidays came around. So instead of feeling excited about holidays I always feared them to some extent. Pretty weird to be anxious about something kids in particular should be excited about.

We recently had a holiday in Australia, and after a few days I wanted to go home. My mum called my pregnant sister heartless and my mum confided in me that she felt dad has abused her emotionally. As someone who has arguably been emotionally abused by their partner I didn't know what to make of it all. Her example of the abuse was kinda strange. ""He's not like he used to be"", citing the fact he was struggling with the automatic car we hired in Aussie. I dunno, was it her bipolar talking, I dunno I don't want to deny her feelings though.

I sometimes wonder if my pessimism stems from my childhood, but I also worry I'm over analysing these things. Looking back I realised how I felt like the least important person In the family. My mum had her manic ups and downs, my dad had a stressful job and was obese. While my sister would argue and fight back, unfortunately I just saw it as evidence she was more important. Whilst also seeing it as adding more stress to mum and dad. So I just went along with whatever to keep the peace, ignoring my own wants and needs. I've also told people when I was a kid my mum didn't take me to the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm, and they suggested that was borderline abuse. I dunno, there was also the time I cut myself with glass as a kid, again my mum didn't take me to the hospital. When my dad saw my cut weeks later he took me to the hospital, but the doctors said it was too late to get stitches and so I have a pretty big scar on my leg.

I still love my mum of course, I know she couldn't always help what happened. I just wish that maybe her condition was explained to me when I was young, i had to figure it out for myself. It also created this issue where I always assume everyone else is more important than me. If someone has mental health issues like my gf I let them get away with anything, because that's what I had to do and was told to do when I was young.",depression

546,t3_dip01h,What's the point of living?," 

Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Posted this first to r/mentalhealth, but this seems to be a more suitable place. I thought that sharing my situation could help me (and maybe some of you guys as well?). I'm not thinking I can find answers or thinking models here - although really appreciated! - , but it would be nice to hear if some of you have the same feelings. A bit of background: I'm a man in my thirties from Central Europe, come from a good family (in my opinion at least, parents divorced though when I was 15), have an education, a loving wife, great and well-paid job, and a lots of friends. So everything is ok at the surface.

But under the surface I'm a total mess. I have been having lots of fears during my life, like fear of vomiting, fear of darkness, fear of having different diseases etc. These fears have been coming and going for some past 20 years, but since the age 12 I have been having fear of dying. It's weird to explain: one part of me has always planned for the future (let's say that in high school planning to which university I want to apply), while one part of me can't think that far to the future, feeling like can't believe that I'm alive on that time. This fear is sometimes stronger and sometimes lighter, but it has always been in the background.

I went to a psychiatrist last Spring and visited also a therapist for a few times. I was diagnosed with mild anxiety disorder and depression, which I could see to come. Most of the summer went similar than it has been, but now within a past month something has snapped in my head and my thinking has changed. I'm thinking death constantly, actively and passively, and the thought of losing consciousness for good is so damn sad, paralyzing, and unbelievable that I just can't handle the idea. I have been also thinking like what's the point of living, because eventually it's coming to an end. I can enjoy and have some good feelings when I'm doing something that really needs concentration and doesn't let my thoughts wander, or modifies my thoughts (like video games, sports, sex, drinking alcohol). But basically during everything else I'm in really deep waters, and of course I can't do these things which bring me satisfaction all the time. And I really can't see the point even doing things I enjoy, because those only bring momentarily satisfaction, and a present for a small moment. I can't take those with me when I die. I'm thinking it would be easier just to die now, because that's going to happen at some point. And at the same time I'm very scared of dying. Please share me your thoughts and feelings!",depression

552,t3_dini3e,I [18F] just quit my job,"I feel absolutely defeated.

I've just quit the third job I've had due to the very same reasons I quit the previous two: I feel incompetent, lazy, and incapable. In addition to this, I felt as though I was being a burden to management due to the multiple crying spells I'd have at work which would result in me sat in a room, crying for up to an hour and a half.

I tried to tough it out this time — I really, really did — but I just couldn't, because constantly I'd be so preoccupied with negative thoughts. I try talking to people but they've no interest when they realise I'm literally depressed. I just can't stand displeasing people, and so I thought everyone would be better off; I can't cause any issues if I'm not there, right?

I started medication yesterday and have been referred to eight weeks' worth of counselling, though these sinister thoughts and feelings I'm experiencing, and have been experiencing for the past six years, won't settle with merely counselling. I can't afford private therapy and the NHS is abhorrent pertaining to mental health.

I needed the break too, after the death of my dad. I wasn't particularly close to him but it hit nonetheless, i.e. the feelings of guilt, shame, anger, mourning a relationship we could've had but didn't. These feelings of incompetence and inferiority I've been experiencing have been with me for a long while, though this merely exacerbated everything to the point in which I could just not function at work, having multiple panic attacks every day for the past four weeks I've been there.

And now my mum and her partner, who both of which I live with and both of who I've tried explaining these things to, are most likely incredibly disappointed in me. I just feel so inferior and as though I'm such a let-down. Who's going to want to employ someone who doesn't have a job, who has an employment gap, due to mental health? Hardly anyone, is who, unless I go back to another call centre which, in my state of mind, I can't afford.

565,t3_dirn8k,Perspective on depression and cancer from somebody with both.,"It's almost a cliche these days for someone with depression to say ""I wish I had cancer.""  I can completely understand the reasoning, too.  Cancer is a lot more visible than depression, it has much better and more reliable treatment options, people are in general a *lot* more sympathetic to people with cancer than people with depression (largely because it's a physical, visible disease), and if worse comes to worse cancer will kill you a lot faster than depression and remove the stigma of self-harm.  I'm sure there are other reasons, too, but even for just the ones outlined, I fully get it.  I used to be in the same boat.

Turns out, support for people with cancer ain't that great, either.  Not in my experience, at least. 

Turns out, I *still* get lots of judgment from people who either don't know me or should know better.  ""You shouldn't have smoked,"" people say.  People who have no idea whether or not I've ever smoked (I haven't).  People who *know* me and *know* that I've never smoked.  *Doctors and nurses* who have my chart.  ""Your diet was shit and you are a garbage person,"" say people who only know me as letters on a screen and have no idea what or how much I've eaten.  ""Eat more vegetables,"" says someone I know who would burst into flames if you showed them a spinach leaf.

Turns out, people *still* shout at me to exercise, because apparently nobody with depression or cancer has ever heard of a damn gym.

Turns out, people *still* tell me to ignore all evidence to the contrary and slavishly devote myself to Mindfulness\^TM and Positivity\^TM no matter *what* the doctors tell me my prognosis is (usually they don't even bother to ask).  Turns out, people *still* insist that Wonderful Magical Blameless Holy **THERAPY**\^TM is a perfect, instantaneous, flawless solution practiced by saintly and tolerate angels who would *never* breach confidentiality or treat me like garbage (they have, fuck them) and who can *absolutely* **CURE FUCKING CANCER** just by talking to you.  

The only real difference I've seen now that I have the cancer diagnosis is that people legitimately fetishize cancer patients.  I am constantly bombarded with creepy, fawning, possessive, and sycophantic DMs and in-person comments from total strangers who ""admire \[my\] strength"" or think I'm ""so brave"" or ""so strong"" or what-have-you.  And if I respond with anything *other* than a smile-and-nod, no matter how honest-to-fucking-God *scary* or *infuriating* or *demeaning* or *objectifying* or *creepy as fucking hell* any given person's comments are, then as far as anyone within earshot is concerned **I'm** the asshole and deserve to die in a gutter so somebody who ""appreciates"" cancer treatment can take my place.

568,t3_dirj4t,I told my mum that I felt like nobody really knows and understands me and she literally told me to fuck off. That‘s the absolute peak so far and I don‘t know how to deal with it.,"I have been struggling with my work lately. Almost every task is frustrating because things and systems that should work just don‘t and on top of that I have my boss who’s, instead of tackling these issues, always on top of me and shitting on me for not being faster.

So I quit about a month and half ago. Where I live I‘m required to continue working there for a certain period (in my case 2 months) so they can find a replacement and I have time to find a new job.

Anyways, over the last few weeks I‘ve had a few breakdowns because after quitting, going to work was even harder for me. I felt even less welcome there and everything became more and more frustrating. On top of that my family has never really been understanding of my situation, always comparing it to their situations or telling me that other people have it worse.

Three weeks ago I started crying at the dinner table and finally got my dad to listen to me. He then started all the bullshit they‘ve always been saying, but for a few minutes he just sat there and listened and it felt great.

Now at this point I should probably clarify that my relationship with my parents is not the greatest. They always told me what to do and they tried to form me into this mini-me version of them, which started to backfire more and more and resulted in me becoming almost a polar opposite of them. When they found out I was smoking weed when I was 18, they made a huge deal about it and ever since then I can‘t leave the house on weekdays without them thinking I‘m out to smoke weed. I still feel guilty of this and ever since then I haven‘t really talked to them unless necessary.

Fast forward to today. I could somehow keep myself motivated for almost two weeks but since yesterday I‘m on a task that just keeps hitting me in the face over and over again. Yesterday at dinner I told my parents that I can‘t wait for this to be over and to be able to tell my boss all the things he‘s responsible for and how he‘s the worst boss I ever had (I know this is kinda overly edgy but for some reason I am like that sometimes). My parents then told me I should never do something like that, it will come back to me, yada yada yada.

They always have been like that. The pawns who just let it get over with and do whatever the kings and queens say. As I stated before I‘m pretty rebellish so I wasn‘t having that. The point is, as always there was no sign of them even trying to understand my behavior. So when I drove home from work today, I started crying because it just got to me that there‘s no place where I really feel at home. When I arrived it was obvious I had been crying so my mum asked me what was wrong. I told her that I don‘t wanna be at work but I also don‘t wanna come home anymore because I feel like they don‘t understand me and they don‘t even know me as a person or try to understand. Her response was to tell me to fuck off and go to a psych ward where maybe somebody had the time to understand me.

This absolutely baffled me and I broke down in tears because this is the absolute peak of this whole downwards spiral. I am currently in bed writing this post while drowning in self-guilt because I keep thinking that I shouldn‘t have said this or that or that I should have neber smoked weed so they would have never found out and all that stuff.




TL;DR: having trouble at work and with my very distant parents and my mom told me to fuck off for telling her that I don‘t think they even try to understand me.

581,t3_dikxnj,Open letter about depression,"  

To those who are depressed, 

I understand the pain and hurt that you are going through. I have walked down that road many times myself. I can certainly empathize with your pain. And there are several other who share the same pain and the same scars of depression.

You may often feel as though you’re on your own in life and that nobody cares about you at all:

People sometimes insult you and make fun of you for your personality and beliefs. They judge you based upon the way you dress, the way you look, and the way you talk and act. They judge you if you’re too quiet, or too loud. If you’re not into the same sports they are, or if you’re not into sports at all. If you have different tastes and preferences than them, or if you’re not in the same clicks that they are in. Because of this, you feel unwanted and left out.

As a result of all this hurt and pain, you begin to feel that there is no hope and no purpose in life and turn to other things to find satisfaction. Perhaps you turn to substances such as drugs or alcohol to numb the pain, different ways of harming yourself, or possibly contemplate suicide as examples of finding “escape” or “comfort”, but at the end of the day your sense of “comfort” doesn’t get met and you still feel miserable.

Whatever the reason may be for your problems, *you are not alone in this struggle.*

Many people are struggling with the same problem.

It is completely normal to experience problems and depression at some point in life. So, if you are experiencing these problems, you are normal. Many others have battled or are still battling this same problem, and there are many people who *do care about you*. **They want to walk with you through this, so you don’t have to go through it alone.** You just need to *find them.* 

Focus on the people who lift you up and encourage you, who do respect you and care for you compassionately. Don’t be afraid to talk to a wise person, a friend, a relative, someone you know and trust. Share with them how sad and depressed you feel and what they might be able to do to come along side you and help you through this

Join a club or organization and surround yourself with like-minded people who will encourage you and speak the truth to you in love, but at the same time hold you accountable when you are wrong. Get involved within your local community and meet new friends there. Spend time with people who care about you and *get to know them.*

You might not see change overnight, but you might within the next few weeks. Just keep holding on. One day will come when you will find the cure for depression, you will meet that good friend and companion, or that future partner or spouse that will meet you in your emptiness and satisfy you with their fun personality, laughter and joy they bring to you. They will restore meaning and fulfillment back into your life again.

But until then just keep holding on. Don’t give up no matter what the circumstance. You do not know when your mood will suddenly take a turn for the better. Do the *best you can* and *be brave*.

Don’t lose heart. 

Don’t lose faith.

Sincerely, 

A Once Depressed Man.",depression

Things didnt really changed since then maybe I've grown more mature but I cannot stop having this feeling. 5 months ago I made some decisions that is also contributing to this(long story, i broke up with the woman I loved and I will probably love the most after 4 years of relatiobship) but the main reason is that life seems so boring, so pointless. I have a nihilist point of view and I literally dont get any satisfaction from living. I have money I'm doing well but it doesn't satisfy me. I have a really nice car is being parked 6 days of the week because I dont like to go anywhere. The only thing that gave me hope and satisfaction was that girl, that I met when we were 18. She s the only reason holding me back not to do it. I mean, we are still good friends and chat quite often, but everytime I end up not replying to her anymore because it just hurts idk..

Our grandparents fought in inhumane conditions, our grandmothers had to wash their loved ones bloodied shirts and wait at home alone for them to come, all for these fucking clowns to fuck around.

596,t3_diq8j7,"NSFW: Took two different antidepressants, they gave me a sort of PGAD","I am a young woman with depression and anxiety (and maybe OCD too, the mental-obsessive thoughts kind). Antidepressants worsened my condition and I experienced a rare side effect too. I first took sereupin (paroxetine), but didn't work, then cipralex (Escitalopram) after several weeks. I took them for 4 days each but I had to stop taking them because they gave me PGA (persistent genital arousal). The first one gave me unbearable priapism, and I had intrusive sexual thoughts and nightmares about rape and men (I am a lesbian) and even paedophilia and incest. I didn't have any pleasurable erotic dream or thought about women, every time I tried to watch some naked woman picture I had a voice inside my head about wanting to penetrate them with my penis (?? Which I don't have). Everything stopped the day I stopped taking it. The second one didn't gave me priapism, only genital arousal and persistent and unpleasant lubrication, intrusive thoughts and nightmares. Cipralex gave me nausea too so every time I have an intrusive thought I almost gag. I took it one week ago, now I am feeling better but I still have some intrusive thoughts, unwanted arousal and nausea. I know the arousal is due to the antidepressant because it feels physically different than my ""normal"" arousal. I also masturbated at a certain point (finally could think about a lovely girl I am going out with) and it didn't went away, almost as if I didn't even had an orgasm. I hope this will go away soon because it's simply horrible, I can't even think about girls anymore because it's so persistent.

She also told me that she thought about suicide at least 3 times a week in high school and thinks about it once in awhile while in college. And she told me that I am the only reason keeping her alive, she can't leave me.

Right now I don't know what to do. I want to get somebody to help, but I feel like it's going back on her trust in me. She takes awhile to open up, it took her two years to open up to me, to her boyfriend. And she did some free counseling at our home institution, but she said she couldn't open up to somebody she didn't know well.

Which is great for her homesickness, but Cambodia doesn't have really any mental health support and her parents will just scold her and ignite the problem.

I posted this last night in r/relationship_advice, but I wanted some more help. Today I woke up barely being able to hold back tears. I want to help her, but she is a very private individual. She's private, because she wants to forget it, but she also doesn't want to burden others.

I explained why I was getting it and she basically said she didn’t want it to get messy and smell even though I told her I wouldn’t let it get like that.

615,t3_dimzgp,"I thought I was doing well, but I don't think anything has changed","I've struggled with depression my whole life, I've found ways to temporarily stave it off but nothing permanent. Recently I thought I had things under control, I was exercising, me and my girlfriend of almost 3 years were getting on well and I was socialising and reconnecting with family and friends. Then, last week, I woke up and for no apparent reason just found myself back in the deep dark hole I spent my entire life in. 

My whole life I've never been able to to stand up for myself, my dad beat and bullied me for as long as I can remember, he beat my mum and did even worse things to her. I got bullied at school, my ""friends"" laughed at me, every girlfriend I've had has walked all over me or I've pushed them away if they didn't. Every time I'm ready to stand up for myself I back down because the consequences aren't worth it (jail time, getting into a fight, getting fired, having to deal with a breakup, etc). I've been to therapy, counselling, none of them seemed to care or I couldn't afford to keep going to the ones that did.

Now I'm 25 and I feel like it's too late to change anything. I'm not even sad anymore, I'm just numb. I'm too exhausted to argue with anyone, I don't really get excited about anything other than being able to be alone for even a small amount of time. I feel like my brain is torturing me, lulling me into a false sense of security and convincing me I'd made progress just to land me back in square one. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I don't know how many more times I can play this game before I just give up. This world is so exhausting, it's like it's built to break you and it's not a matter of if, but when it breaks you. All behaviour except sitting and eating the shit life spoon-feeds you is socially unacceptable 

I know I'm probably gunna be fine in a day or two but I just can't accept that I'm going to spend the rest of my life at the mercy of my own god damn brain. It's maddening, infuriating and makes me wish I could just end it but again, the consequences just aren't worth it.

It's weird how the brain snowballs over the smallest of issues. Bad news coupled with a well meant mistake is bouncing in my mind, telling me how little I'm worth, how useless and unwanted I am. I was having a good day (turns out toothpaste really does defog your lights!) but sometimes a single text can bring me crashing down, and I know its gonna stick with me for decades to come. And those memories are hard to keep at bay, especially when even miniscule stuff pop in my head...but that just brings sad memories. So many friends of mine have died, so many family members, people I cared about gone, and here I am: an at-home millennial caring for a family member, with a low pay job and nowhere to go. All my diplomas mean squat, nowhere is hiring, and the water keeps rising. Looking at social media kills me sometimes, watching old friends succeed so much in life. I'm so happy for them, don't get me wrong, but it feels like a spotlight sometimes, at just how much I've failed. My mental and physical health has plummeted, some of it sticking with me lifelong. I feel like my boss wants me gone, as does my family, and as much as I want to disappear, as much as the little voice in my head wants me to, I can't bring myself to do it.

Cause it wins if I do, right? Things can get worse, and they probably will, but as long as I'm alive, there's a chance. Just a chance it'll improve. I want help, but I can't afford it, and addiction problems are rampant in my family. But for now I'll keep moving forward, I have to. I'll keep trying. I hope you do too.

birthed into existence

only to be consumed.

Boring and small and not loved

and not hated

and not thought of

and not wanted

by anyone

but me.


And so for a short interval

between its assembly

and its death

the cup had purpose

to be drank from

and enjoyed and digested

until its reserve

of taste and liquid

is exhausted.

The best purpose

that a drink can hope for.


But the cup of tea

was quickly forgotten

by its busy creator.

He, I, had other affairs

of a human nature

of which a tea

could not be aware,

or understand,

or control.


I was gone

But the tea was still there

left alone on my desk,

its warmth leaving its body,

its scent attracting ants

and flies

and other raiders and scavengers

of leftover nutrition,

its temporary value,

its purpose,

dwindling away.


The tea would run

somewhere, everywhere.

Anywhere

would be better than here,

than the cold desk,

the dark, so thick and shallow,

but the tea had no legs.


The tea would scream

It would call for somebody,

everybody, anybody at all.

630,t3_dimdab,What am I?,"I tend to hide my chronic sadness. I don't feel like talking to people I'm comfortable with and am constantly willing to talk to people whom I'm anxious with (which I avoid although I am desperate to talk to somebody, due to my anxiety).  I'm just too anxious, uncomfortable to show how sad I really am. I feel constantly angry, easily irritated, but either show fake smile, or try hard to avoid people that trigger me.  I have decent earning but I don't know what I am supposed to do with it, cuz I am scared to spend it, and I can't say this to anybody, like ""Man! I am scared to spend my money on buying lunch"". LOL. Moreover, eating, travelling, buying new things and using them doesn't give me any pleasure. I want to have a girlfriend but I am too scared to say ""I love you"" to anybody. I am always dying for sex, but after having one, I feel terrible, like it was no joy. Maybe, I imagine too much about something that is about to happen in near future. My imagination is sooo beautiful, but when it happens in reality, it's just another ordinary event, and makes me soo sad :(. I also feel totally lonely at work. I am alone in the office room. Whenever I hear my senior worker's voice coming closer to me, my heart pounds, my breating stops. (Same happens when I have to ask/talk to a stranger or even more when I am around beautiful women.) I am scared that my employer will ask me to do some work and I won't be able to do it perfectly (doing it averagely won't make me satisfied, so the option I take is avoiding the work mostly). I just want to be perfect at everything but am scared to do anything because I know it wont be perfect. So I just can't do anything. I am totally paralyzed. I am scared to ask office servant even a cup of water and even if I manage to ask, I don't feel joy that I mustered courage to ask. My life is just like this. Everything I do, it gives me no joy. Everything I don't, I curse myself for not being able to do it. While my friends are busy looking for better paying jobs, finding life partners, enjoying travelling, eating, I have no purpose. I don't want to work but without work I'll have no money and I will be depressed at home. But I also feel like hitting rock bottom could open new doors in life. I don't know. I'm going nuts.  


I feel soo paralyzed, like I can't even go to a shop and ask for grocery items because I won't be able to do it 100% confidently. Doing it nervously, awkwardly will only make me more depressed so I better choose to not do anything at all. But that's not taking me anywhere either. So I'm stuck. I don't know what's going on with me. I have been doing yoga, physical exercises,  breating exercises every fucking morning for the past 3 months but still this keeps on bothering me. Everys single moment I am thinking of something, then contracting myself and finally not doing anything. Just lying there, cursing myself :(.

631,t3_dikb3z,Yeah so no one talks to me :(,"**(A bulk of this post is just adding context to the question. I've put the question in bold at the bottom so I can save you all some time. Thanks!)**

Just a quick text bit. I'm like 20 years old, doing a four year degree, and I'm lonely as shit. Lonely can be a bit of an understatement. I'm not really looking for solutions since most people just ask me to change my personality completely (which is hard and idk if I or anyone knows how to do that.) I'm not depressed, well I haven't been diagnosed but I want to believe I'm not. 

So in terms of friends. I define it loosely as someone who I talk to and they talk back to me. Someone I can lend a hand and they lend me a hand in return. Thanks to that definition, I don't really have much going in terms of friends. No one ever messages me first unless it's something related to work or business.   


There's no:  
""How are you doing?""   
""What are you up to?""  
""Wan't to hang out?""   
Not even some interesting picture or meme they would want to show me. No I'm the one that's sending these kinds of messages all the time. To be honest I do get very nice conversations from this. Some get pretty deep, we learn a bit about each other and then just say goodbye and  go on with our day. 

The elephant in the room is that I'm the one always initiating this. I always look out for people, offer them a shoulder to cry on or a favor without expecting repayment. It's in my nature, my entire lifestyle is built around making people happy. I often attend volunteerism events, let people vent their problems to me, take parts of a project if it looks like someone is too constrained to do their part. The least the world could do for me is give me someone that would care for me as much as I care for them. But obviously where all on this thread for the reason that the world isn't fair. I have no intention to stop trying to make people happy since there's nothing that brings me more joy than a smile on someone's face. So since I have no real friends, **I wanted to ask what I can do to cope with being lonely all the time. I have no intention of forcing someone to initiate conversations with me, that's just selfish. I just have a large amount of free time and I want to get my mind off being lonely, so please give me your suggestions on what I can do. Thanks in advance.**

Oh I need a car while Im here. Did it still empty. Go out do this do that still empty. Oh Ineed a gf, I met this amazing girl and we fell in love and after a while I started feeling empty again but never said anything because I wanted her to be happy because that was me my whole life just trying to make other people happy because if they are happy than I’m happy too. My next thing was getting an internship and I get this amazing internship in the summer and after that I still felt empty. Oh well now I need to get a job offer once I graduate. The internship makes me a job offer and I still feel empty. 
My gf broke up with me and I dont blame her because I couldn’t really love her because I don’t even love myself. But that shit hurts because now Im lonely and I have to face myself again. I started going to therapy and it opened my eyes that I need to face myself.

Recently I opened to a friend about my depression and she said: I would have never thought that, you’re always looking good, dressing nice and people love you.

I hate taking responsibilities and growing into an adult because without a doubt I'll fail hard at meeting them, I just want to lie down and do nothing,and that's what I do, but that has consequences and I've just been piling them up, I'll undoubtedly have to deal with them eventually, outside of the things I'll have to deal that aren't consequences of my lack of acrion and I can't see that as a being good and painless experiences, I just see a horrible and meaningless future looming over me and I see no purpose or end goal going through with it, maybe because I already live more or less the way I'd want to continue living but I won't be able to.

I've been able to keep living in a pretty good and non-active way, but that has been on the back of the goodwill of others and they're most probably really disappointed in me, I've failed them when they gave me opportunity and failed myself by undermining my own future, I just don't have any will to keep going forward and to be honest, I've never had, I've just been dragging my own self through my whole life and now I just want to lie down, if I'm dragging myself to the mud or grass I'll have to drag myself through thorns next, I'd have to walk with boots through there but I don't even have the strength to get up.

I don't even know how I got this far with how much I mess up and don't care, maybe outside I just have a friendly personality and people give me opportunities because of that, my mother says a lot of people would love to be on my place and she's right, although we aren't well off we live in a reasonably good way, most of the world would kill to be me in my rather poor and old single pair of shoes to have the opportunities to have the good education I had and can have but I just don't care, I don't really dislike my life, I just hate having to live at all.

And now I've just done what is probably the biggest blunder in my life, and why would I want to deal with that? Maybe I'm selfish and maybe I'm whiny, after squandering the biggest opportunity of my life and it's all my fault, consequence of my lack of action, but really I never wanted opportunity, I never wanted something greater, I have no ambition, all I've always wanted is just to be a nobody and do nothing of value all day.

I just don't know what to do now, I guess I'll have to deal with my problems but even if I can resolve things that path isn't much better, it's full of responsibility and hard work, and more of the looming problems of my future I'll have to deal with, I don't want to do that and I don't want to deal with that.

I just don't know what to do and I don't want to know, I don't want to deal consequences, I don't want to have responsibilities, my friends and family aren't worth the trouble and although my pets seemed worth it, they're now less and less worth it.

I have recently just finished school, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing now. As with a lot of people, I used to be that A+ kid who are everyone looked up to and now I suck. And that's not opinion, I literally gave up on school and slept through most exams and ignored every teacher. I did this because I was in so much pain.

3 years ago, before I was depressed, I was in love with someone. Yeah it was your typical kinda high school lovey Dovey stuff but importantly it was long-distance (no we didn't meet online, we were friends irl but I moved country). I was so in love with this wonderful girl, I gave her unconditional love. And then one day she just... Disappeared. She wouldn't answer my texts... Or read emails... Like, nothing. It was as if she died. I genuinely believed for 4 months that she had died, and I had no way of contacting her family or friends.

Then one day she texted me, and explained how she never actually loved me at all. She was taking it because she didn't want to hurt me. But she completely messed that up because it broke me. It really did. And not just ""extremely lonely and depressed"" kinda deal but I attempted suicide so many times. So many. Each time I just couldn't do it. 

This continued on for a while, and my grades in school were dropping rapidly. At this point, I hadn't quite given up, but I was close. I was just so tired of pain and I wanted it to stop. 

Then I met another girl, and for once, FINALLY, I wasn't in pain. I could finally look forward and start thinking about the future. Note: I wasn't dating this girl we just had a close friendship. Then the day came and I asked her, ""Would you like to go on a date?"" I was certain. Nope. She crushed my heart completely, I was devastated. I broke down even more than before, and I'm not kidding, I tried commuting suicide every single day. But every day I failed because I couldn't do that last action that would finish it.

Because I don't want to die, I just want to be happy with a family. 

I never met my father, he left before I was born. And I have never been close to my mother. I'm not saying she's a bad mother, but I just don't like her as a person. I really don't. I tend to avoid her at all costs. I have no brothers or sisters or other family members anywhere near me (closest one is on the other side of the world). I had school friends but I saw none of them outside of school and they never invited me to things like parties.

My grades kept dropping, and I was borderline failing all my subjects. And it was at this point, a few weeks ago, where I have completely and utterly hit rock bottom. There is no where to go. I cannot even go up. I found out that my mother has cancer and will likely pass in the next few months. After this I will have no friends, no family, no one.

The hobbies that I used to enjoy doing I no longer enjoy. I just want to... Not exist. I don't want to die, because I think that'd be painful. I just want to have never existed. 

Everyday I wake up and hope that somehow.... SOMEHOW against all odds and a miracle happens that someone texts me and says ""I love you"" and I can just be happy. 

I got a job as I thought this might help, but that turned out to be very wrong and I hate it. Every waking moment of my life is now spent worrying about my job (which is minimum wage at a supermarket stocking shelves). I just hate everything. Life has been so cruel to me. Everytime I roll the dice, it rolls off the table. 

What do I do? I've tried talking to therapists but their advice hasn't helped in the slightest. What do I do????? I so desperately just want someone to be friends with, but I can't. They never stay for long.

I just.... Don't know what to do.",depression
641,t3_dinzou,Can't keep going with my life,"Like I don't even know how to start this. I'm 17 years old male, going to high school. Also English is not my first language but you should be able to understand. 
The thing is that I can't find a reason for my sadness. The only thing I know is that everything is going downhill. It started probably 7-8 months ago. My parents are I don't really know. I really try to just ignore them and don't spend a lot of time with them. I don't like people at all. I'm not ugly at all, I have a decent amount of money and never had problems with school. Like everything seems good. But it's not. I just want to kill myself. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I stopped doing everything. Grades are very bad right now, I can't focus on anything. I've seen that I should find something that I enjoy but no luck. I tried going out with friends, tried drawing ( I was very good at digital but stopped because I didn't enjoy it anymore ) ( both on paper and on the computer ), tried training, tried changing my daily routines, waking up earlier and nothing at all. Every day it seems worse. I don't feel anything towards people that I really loved. Like the only thing that prevents me from doing that is my dad. Mom became abusive, she keeps telling me that I'm not important anymore whenever I try to speak about anything. I pushed so many people away so they won't care when I kill myself. I have diabetes but I don't think it is important now. I got it when I was 3 years old so it's not a reason for this. The only thing I keep thinking of is ways to commit suicide. I don't want to meet new people because I don't want them to attach to someone like me. When I don't think about suicide I don't think about anything. It's just blank. One thing to mention is my ex, I met her 4 years ago and couldn't move on about that. Like I'm so happy that she just moved on, like how the fuck people even move on? Whenever some girl tries something with me I'll try to find my ex in her. But there is no way its because of her. I texted her a few days ago and I feel nothing. I was like ok it might be better when I text her but no. It's not better. Every day keeps getting worse as I said. Did I move on? Or is it the same as it is for everyone else that stopped caring? I'm fucking lost, I need to go to a therapist and I will in like week or so but I just feel I might end it before that.

643,t3_dikq6x,"Im 26/no family, friends, nor people who care anymore. I think im done","Like the title says, im a 26 year old dude with a family I hate due to a shitty childhood. My dad was in the military so I moved from school to school when I was young. Never staying in a place longer than 2 years, which conditioned me to just avoid making friends or getting too close to people. I was going to lose them anyways, eventually. And now I'm sure no one I know would really care if I was gone.

My depression is like most of yours, from what I've been reading, feeling completely empty, always tired, I hate myself with ever fiber in my being. I feel like I'm a constant fuck up, whenever I'm about to be rewarded for my work and effort, for some ungodly reason, I tear down everything I put effort in because I feel like I'm a fraud of a person.

Most people wouldn't consider me a failure. In fact I'm often a team lead at work for being an ""exceptional example "", but it's just a mask I wear to keep people from knowing who I really am. A piece of shit. 

 I work in sales, and I'm often striving to be the best. I felt like if I drowned myself in work I wouldn't drown when im alone. I often force myself to work most of the day, often clocking in 13hr days, 6 days out of the week. Obviously my bosses think I'm just a hard worker trying to make as much money as I can. Its sales, so as long as I produce they don't really care. Im just a money maker who doesn't complain.  But the reality of it all, im trying to run away from what I really am. I don't care about the money, the people, my reputation, anything really. 

As I get older things intrest me less. I no longer care for sex, or even getting the motivation to masturbate. I quit smoking weed, drinking, anything that typically worsens depression. But its still there.

I started working out more. In fact I went from weighing over 360lbs to now 247lbs. I eat healthy and take vitamins everday. But its still there. 

I've tried LSD in an effort to help curb my depression, it helped a bit. But its still here. 

Now I'm supposed to move to another state, where I'll be ""starting over"" again. But I don't think I'll make it, lately I've really been considering suicide. I bought a gun, im just waiting for the waiting period to end. I was thinking that if I can't find, create, or make up a reason to continue.  Then this is it.

No one will care once im gone, I never benefited anyone who cares about me. 

I'm just rambling now. Anyways, I guess this is just my good bye. 

I have nothing to look forward to if I continue. 

I meet new people daily, cool people, interesting people, people with a sense of purpose and I often try to pick their brain to see what makes them tick. I think some people are just blind to the suffering around them. I envy them. 

I've tried everything to help curb depression, so far the only thing that helped was the LSD. But now the water is over my head, and I'm chained to the ocean floor. Every attempt is like a wet slap on a cement wall 100ft thick.

Im not proud of what I'm about to do but it feels necessary. Dead things shouldn't pretend to live, im putting myself in the right place.

I went to the doctor and got a blood test, and was terrified I was dying of some awful disease. I looked up the symptoms of meningitis like an idiot and, because I had had a headache for like 3 weeks I was absolutely terrified I was going to die. 

The results came back and I was severely iron and vitamin D deficient, because of my poor diet and lack of exercise. It’s easily fixable with vitamin supplements and a healthy diet plan but I was so ashamed when the results of my blood test came back.

That’s it? 

All that awful ordeal and I just needed some iron tablets? I was so ashamed I had acted so overdramatically over it.

I thought I might have a good week when I was feeling a bit better and wow, maybe even a bit happy over the weekend and on Monday... But I guess happiness is just not for me...

It seems like ignorance and distractions, alongside fantasy, are the only things that can actually bring me any kind of peace, and it isn't a full fledged relaxing inner peace, it's more like a calm before a storm... It's just there, not really happy...

I just don't know what to do about anything... The only thing that brings me anything resembling happiness is just my only friend, who basically, doesn't exist... They're the only ""person"" that has ever treated me good and has been there to support me... But they don't exist, they're just in my imagination...

Why am I wasting everyone's time?.. I don't even know if I should post this... Depends on how desperate I am...

I really thought maybe this week would be different... But at the end of the day I just always end up realizing my existence is absolutely meaningless... And that I will die alone, and nothing will happen after death... And I'm really scared of that...

I'm so scared... But hey... Who cares?..
Not even I do, it seems...

I would've already committed suicide several times if I wasn't such a coward... I'm just a complete failure with nothing to offer...

What in the bloody hell should I do?..

I don't know, and I don't want to take up space for other people who need the help so much more than I do...

I think school messes with my head a lot. I’m awful at presentations—literally cannot speak well during them. I’m a listener, and I like working with people in groups and 1:1. I know I can work well with people; I’ve been a CNA and I’ve worked in a couple group homes throughout the past 4/5 years. Yet, my school work performance (and how it leads to anxiety mainly) is tearing down my self-esteem about being a counselor. I do get socially awkward sometimes in a conversation, but I feel like it happens most when I get in my head and think “they’re judging me” or “they’re thinking ____” or “they’re staring at _____”.

It’s terrifying knowing that I’ll have to present classroom lessons as a school counselor. Most of us students didn’t learn that until after we began the program, as you wouldn’t really think that a counselor did that?! So I’m honestly already dreading that aspect.

666,t3_dik1gv,i’m not looking forward to the future,"i’m an all ap’s (advanced placement) high school student because i naturally am pretty smart, and a lot of people are like omg you’re so lucky like if you wanted you could drop down to regular classes and literally never go and still get high 90s. 

which is true i’m sure i could do this but i’ve built my whole life up to go to some prestigious college and get some high up science-y job so i have to stay in my ap classes or else i’m not living up to my potential, and therefore am a disappointment, however unhappy they may make me. 

my whole life i have conditioned myself to feel unworthy if i don’t do well or don’t take the hardest courses. for instance, i’m sure i’ll never use ap lang or ap us history but i feel obligated to take them because if i don’t i’m not doing what i believe i need to be doing. 

recently i’ve come to a realization that i’m setting myself up for a life where i’m miserable. if i, a junior in high school, haven’t been able to get through a day where they’re not suicidal in years it is clear that something i’m doing isn’t right. i’m sure it’s a combination of brain chemistry and the life i’ve chosen to live, but brain chemistry can’t be controlled by my conscious decision. i have consciously chosen to make myself miserable time and time again and it’s too late to turn back now. i have become a person i never wanted to be. my values aren’t what i want them to be. 

i’ve sacrificed art countless of times because even though i’m a pretty good artist, i’m an equally (if not better) as good science and math student. my 97 is honors precalc looks better than a 97 in an art elective i could have taken. i understand that logically an art class is viewed as a lot lower than a math class but it’s still depressing. 

granted art wouldn’t make me feel different about the bleakness of the world, but it would lessen it, allow me to express what i had to say in something other than a ridiculously long and all over the place reddit post. art, even english, allows you do express something you can’t in kinematics in physics or stoichiometry in chemistry (those are my other two aps in case you were curious). but, i digress. 

my point is, i think, i feel hopeless. my life isn’t what i want it to be, and i realized it too late. my dream of living in a small cottage with my wife and our adopted children and our chickens and our art studio and our berry fields will never happen. because i’m going to be a scientist some day, and i’m going to probably become an alcoholic (i recently picked up a habit of drinking when i’m super depressed and it feels g r e a t, however bad i know it is) and commit suicide before i turn 30. i suppose i’ve accepted that, i just wish i could have the life i want to have but i was given this bullshit gift of natural intelligence and i have to use it. 

and perhaps i’m blaming it too much on circumstance and not enough on brain chemistry but does it really matter? if i’m not willing to change circumstance then brain chemistry doesn’t change anything anyway. it’s like how people always ask did nazis actually believe in all the stuff hitler said or were they just terrified of him? it doesn’t matter because the holocaust still happened either way. extreme analogy but same concept and i don’t know another example of it, so i apologize if it left a poor taste in anyone’s mouth. i apologize as if anyone is even reading this. 

odds are no one is, because everyone on this sub reddit is in a very similar boat as i am and unfortunately all of those boats have holes. we read a speech today in english written by this guy david wallace and he talked about how we are only aware of us and we must learn to perceive others. he used the example of this: 

an old fish swims by two young fish and says: ‘the water’s pretty nice today’ and swims away 

after one of the younger fish turns to the other and says: ‘what the hell is water’ 

my point in saying this is that everyone has a life and as people we have a very difficult time comprehending the fact that other people are the center of their universe, just as we are our own. so ‘the water’ in this instance can’t be perceived by the young fish because they haven’t learned how to perceive it, similar to how it’s impossible for me to know what’s going on at the center of your universe. and that was one of the points david wallace made, in edition to describing the endless bleak cycle most of us fall into: get up, go to work/school, come home, eat, unwind, sleep, repeat. 

it was weird because i was both comforted and upset by this fact, i figured oh! here’s a normal guy who feels the same way i feel about the way i live my life but also thought, wow here’s a guy who, according to my perception, is completely normal and feels like this too, meaning even if i wasn’t as depressed as i was, life would still be like this. 

i found out about 5 minutes after i thought this that david wallace actually killed himself 3 years after delivering this speech.

i don’t know where this has gone, i don’t know if anyone’s reading. basically, the world seems bleak and there’s nothing i can do about it. thanks for tuning in.",depression

670,t3_dih560,Extremely Depressed and Overwhelmed :(,"I am severely depressed and suicidal. I have a couple friends, but not many, and I am not very good at sustaining the friendships I have had/do have. I am 16, but I can't drive, and I just started homeschooling last month. I left my previous school because of bullying from both parents and students (due of the fact that I traded pills last year because my then-boyfriend asked me to). I understand that they have a right to be mad, but it was last year, did not involve anyone at that school, and it is a private Christian school, and aren't Christians supposed to forgive?  Anyway, my classmates (all 12 of them) started isolating me, not telling me about parties that the whole class (except me) was invited to, and many other things I don't feel like going into. Their parents started complaining to the principal and headmaster about me, asking ""why is someone like her at this school?"" and trying to get him to kick me out. He told me and my mother about this, and although he did not kick me out, it hurt me deeply to know that I was unwanted by so many people because of one incident. I knew that they were now looking for any reason to expel me, so I saw no other choice except for me to leave. I cannot afford to be expelled, as it would ruin absolutely everything. There was no other high school that I could go to, since I had had to leave my previous school due to my extremely severe (and untreated at the time) anxiety. So I started online school, and am home alone almost all day. As one imagine, this has made me more lonely. I also have anorexia, which I had to go to residential treatment for in the summer, which meant I could not go to my internship with the New York Times that I had been so excited about. My ex-boyfriend was emotionally abusive, and his words were a big thing that led me to starve myself. We have been broken up for almost 5 months, and I jut learned yesterday that one of my closest friends likes him, and he likes her back. She is not sure of what to do, and I am not angry with her, but it just hurts so much. I loved him deeply, and just when I thought I had gotten over it, this happened. I want to be with someone so badly, but no one wants to be with me. My thoughts of suicide have become more intense, and I feel so alone.",depression

I've been struggling really hard with my depression lately. Anytime I bring it up with my boyfriend he acts like I'm saying either he is making me depressed, or that he isn't good enough. Obviously I'm not saying any of that. I've had diagnosed depression for 9 years, but a few doctors believe it probably started 18 years ago (when I was 6 and had my first suicidal urges). I began self harming 12 years ago, and the past year and a half the urges have been harder to control again. I just feel like a loser, a failure, and a lost cause. If I didn't have my son to take care of I would probably just give up. Sometimes I wonder if he would be better off without me though. His step mom is great, better than I am. I'm not really sure whay the point of this post is. I'm just sad, and tired, and dealing with thoughts of suicide and self harm for so many years is exhausting.

682,t3_dikpq9,"A story of falling in love, ramblings of depression, and perseverance.","I had a bad break up going on five years ago. I was torn apart on the inside, and it took me several years to come back from it. I dated a few women over the following two years , but it only lasted a month at most. Mostly because I've had such a poor self-image since the break up. Whenever I would try to date, my depression and insecurities would cause me to shut down and isolate myself until the relationship fell apart. I decided I needed to stop dating, at least temporarily, and work on me. I needed to go back and finish college so I could get out of the dead-end, low-paying jobs I've been working, and I needed to learn to be more responsible in general. I think deep down, I felt like I wasn't worthy of being loved until I could at least do that. It took one of the longest and deepest depressions of my life to realize all of this, I barely came out of it alive. That was almost exactly two years ago.

After that I was good, my depression was almost completely absent. I went back to college, I was doing well in my classes, I worked part-time, I hung out with my two best-friends when I could, I was more or less happy and felt driven. I thought I'd maybe try to date again once I finished school and got a better job, once my life had settled down a bit.

During these last two years, my friend and his girlfriend would often bring up a woman they worked with and that I should ask her out. I'd tell them I don't have the time in my life right now to have a relationship, which wasn't necessarily untrue. My friend's girlfriend would bring it up routinely, even texting me a picture of her. She looked beautiful, and I told the girlfriend that, but didn't pursue it any further. Then one day, I get a text from an unknown number and it's the woman they'd been telling me about. We texted for the next two weeks, until my therapist told me to ask her out. I told him why I hadn't, and he said it sounded like I was making excuses as to why not to. He was right, I was. So I did. I figured, what can it hurt? We'll probably go out, and nothing will come of it. This was just over five months ago.

We went to a Mexican restaurant, and ended up talking for three hours up until they closed. We went on another date the next weekend, spending over two hours talking again. I was reluctant, probably because on some level I don't love myself, so I don't see how someone else could love me. But we kept seeing each other. The time factor played a role, we only saw each other once a week for the first several months. But I was starting to like her more and more, and she started to like me more and more. I started to realize that I was falling in love with her, but part of me wouldn't have it. I didn't want to go through the pain I went through in my last relationship, and I felt like I was setting myself up for that. The self-loathing probably had something to do with it too. I kept her at arms-length, only seeing her so often.

Then on my birthday, which was over a month ago, she gave me the best gift I have ever gotten from anyone. It was so simple, but it engraved her spot deep in my heart. It filled me with so much love, and from such a simple gift. She bought me a bunch of candy, and each bag had a card with a pun on it. The sour patch kids bag read, ""My life is less sour with you in it"". The Swedish fish bag read, ""You're the sweedish fish in the sea"". The butterfingers package read, ""I don't want to let you slip through my butterfingers"". Those along with several other heart-touching candy puns.

Over the last month a half, we've been spending more and more time together. I've fallen head over heels for her, and she has for me. This all sounds wonderful, but depression has reared it's ugly head in my life yet again. The near-constant self-doubt and self-loathing, the fear of the pain that will follow if the relationship crashes and burns like my past relationships. I don't see what she loves about me, and it only fuels the fire when I think about that. Sometimes I think about breaking it off. I tell myself it'd be for her own good, but I know I'm really only trying to save myself.

I think about the pain it'll bring her, and I can't bring myself to do it. I can't tolerate the thought of her in pain, especially pain inflicted by me. But that's not the only reason I can't. I also can't because with her I see a possibility. The possibility of a lasting love. When you cut through all the bullshit, that's what I want. A best-friend, a lover, someone that I can always depend on and that can always depend on me. That's what we've started to become to each other. So I'm not going to let my depression rob me of the chance of having that, not when life has so unexpectedly given me someone that's come to mean so much to me in these short five months. She knows I'm not perfect, and she loves me all the same. I know she's not perfect, and I love her all the same. If it ends in heartbreak, then at least I'll know I tried. 

I guess I'm sharing this story to possibly inspire others to not give up. And when the prospect of love pops up in your life, don't let it pass. You'll always be alone if you do. I'd convinced myself the last five years that being alone is what I wanted, but it's not. I've just been too afraid to feel lost love again, too afraid that the other person will see me the way I see me. I'm not going to let my depression and fear keep me from feeling the love I deserve, and you shouldn't either. I know that's easier said than done, but love is worth the struggle.",depression

693,t3_dimgxa,Suicidal in a Foreign Land,"I feel like I am very close and even at peace with committing suicide.

I was already close to committing suicide but an ex-online boyfriend that I have known for close to a decade convinced me to move to foreign land and restart my life. He offered for me to move in with him and his boyfriend while I got onto my feet. A few months into the move, my ex was arrested by the government (I don't wish to discuss the details) and I was left alone with his boyfriend to pick up the pieces. At first we were just friends, but over the months of his absence, we grew very close and started a relationship. We always intended to tell my ex immediately, and didn't want to push him away from us, we wanted to enter into a poly relationship. Looking back now, it was a major mistake to begin this without his permission, but at the time we were both very lonely and hurt and we both agreed that the ex would likely be ok with what we were doing and that he would accept me into the relationship upon his release.

As it turns out he's very upset about what has occurred; however, I also feel like he doesn't fully understand the situation as he believes I intended to steal his boyfriend, and I did not. All I ever desired was love and closeness from both parties. I feel wronged because I was ready to die before this and he begged me to come and start over and then through his own actions got arrested.

I have no real friends and I left my Family because they abused me mentally, though we are still on speaking terms. I just feel tired. I'm tired of getting my hopes up. I'm tired of people expressing love and care for me only to withdrawal it when it becomes inconvenient for them. I'm tired of fighting with nothing to show for it.

I am attempting one last dialogue with my ex and his boyfriend to try to sort things out. It takes a long time for communication to happen as I can only communicate with him through the mail and it has to go through several prison screening processes. He will be released in May. I will probably be dead before then. I just want someone to know what has happened to me. A helium exit bag will be very easy to assemble here. Being a homosexual is suffering.",depression

But I love myself so much that no matter what external or internal stressors/bad energy I get from others, I will try my best to get through them cause I love myself to not harm myself and will use these bad times to only get stronger as a person.

It took me awhile to really have Self-Love for myself. Even thru hell and until the day I die I will always love myself. No matter what, even if the world hates me. I love me, ima get through my own mental issues and life problems but I will become a better version of myself. These tough times made me even greater by getting through them with self love. Like I legit could of ended it a long time ago but I love myself. Nothing can stop me and I know I wont stop myself thru self harm, I just hope someone who is going through the similar type thing mentally or with problems in life sees this and realize your not alone.

695,t3_dihsd6,Sometimes my friends jokes hurt my feelings,"Today a friend told me that all I make are self deprecating jokes and another person told me that my jokes aren’t even that funny. My friends have made fun of the music I listen to and one of them said I’m the most wound up person they’ve ever met. I’m a girl with pretty hairy arms and the one day I decided to take my jacket off my friend said “why are your arms so fucking hairy”. He apologized after and said he was kidding but it still hurt I guess. Another time a guy friend pointed out the hair on my chin. That really hurt. 

I’m not saying my friends are assholes. I make fun of them too, but sometimes certain things just get to me. It’s my fault for being sensitive, not theirs.


I really try to be funny and liked but I guess I’m not. I haven’t worn anything with short sleeves in a year. I take showers in the dark because I can’t stand my body. I avoid mirrors. My dreams have been crushed because I’m not good enough to make them come true. I’ve never had a boyfriend and I probably never will. I’m not talented and I’m sure as hell not smart. I try and I try and I try and nothing ever works out. 

My friends don’t know any of that. I’m not saying they’re assholes because everyone makes fun of each other sometimes, but it still hurts. I can’t help being sensitive because every little thing ruins me. Even if it’s just a harmless joke, it runs in my head and I can’t help but to let it get to me. They don’t understand the half of what I go through. But I guess that’s my fault. 


Sometimes things like this make me think if I’m truly faking it. I mean if no one else takes my depression seriously, am I just overreacting? Am I faking it? Am I being over dramatic? I feel so broken and I try to put myself back together but it’s so hard.

697,t3_dihoou,"Today when talking about a coworker who is sensitive to suicide related jokes, my coworkers, including boss, urged those who make jokes to ""man up"" ""grow a pair"" and get it over with.","My workplace is a normally painstakingly PC one. However, the past two weeks my chronic depression has been so much worse than normal, probably the worst it has ever been. I've been managing it by keeping headphones on and just listening to audiobooks or podcasts or music to distract myself from my intrusive thoughts.   


Today, between albums, I overheard a coworker make a joke about work making him want to kill himself. Honestly, I use humor offset my own depressive or negative thoughts, and I make jokes like this all too often. I actually have to police myself about it, because we have a super kind coworker who is VERY sensitive to the subject matter, and have been asked by him, and others, to not make those jokes because it upsets him. I said, to the coworker who made the suicide joke, ""Haha, me too. Make sure to not say that in front of D------ though! He gets really bothered by that stuff."" At which point two of my coworkers (one of which is my superior, and the one who initially told me not to joke about suicide?!) started joking aloud, with others around laughing, that they wished people who made those jokes would just ""grow a pair"" and ""get it over with!"" I mean... they surely have no idea how deep my depression runs, though I have talked with both parties about it before. It is just **such** an insensitive and dangerous comment to make. One of which followed it up by saying that he has a gun that ""they"" could borrow, and then the conversation spiralled into whether or not that gun would be ideal for suicide. I felt like every urge in me just intensified. I then TALKED MYSELF DOWN by telling myself how terrible **THEY** would feel if they woke up to the news of me killing myself, right after they said that. I also have lost several friends to suicide and OD via substance abuse (which is really the same thing, in its own way). It made me so unreasonably angry to think that someone would EVER encourage them, even in jest, to take their lives. Two of them were coworkers of mine, and we bonded over our depression and passive dark humor.

704,t3_diftbr,Stuck in a career I hate with no way out,"I've been a lawyer for twelve years and have hated every living second of it.  The pay hasn't even been that good.  I have a real passion and, I believe, some talent for an artistic field, but it's next to impossible to break into for someone in my position.  I don't have the right degree, and my identity isn't very interesting by the standards of wokeness that now govern the arts (I do NOT want to have political discussion, I'm just explaining my situation).  

I'm depressed because I really see no way out from this.  I have kids to support, I can't just quit my job, and anyway, any other job that I can get will still involve white-collar paper-pushing and no outlet for my creativity.  I practice my art in my spare time, but I don't have very much of that, and it's not satisfying because no one else knows about it.  

I'm forty.  I look ahead and see nothing but two, maybe three more decades of day after day of maddening, soul-crushing boredom while my talent continues to atrophy.  I honestly don't know how I can make it through the rest of the day, let alone the next 30 years.  My kids give me a reason to stay alive, but this isn't much of a life.  In fact, it's more like a hike up an infinite mountain with a hundred pounds of gear on your back. .  Alcohol helps, but you can only do so much of that before it starts to get in the way of work and family obligations.

I don't have a point, I'm just venting.  It's unfortunate that we live in a society that assumes that just because you're smart, you must want to work in a professional type of job.  I chose my career before I really knew myself, and it turns out I chose very poorly.",depression

We come here when we feel alone and need some support we don’t receive in our actual lives, whether that support be relating to others who go through the same experiences or being able to rant. With that said, I am here to rant about how fucking disappointed I am in myself today. I will try and amend things, but I am just really freaking upset right now with how nothing went to plan today and nobody in my life will understand why I didn’t just wake up and get out of bed when my alarms rang. 

I had a volunteering interview at 10, but when I woke up at 9, I just had no desire to get out of bed. It was definitely not the same feeling as wanting more sleep. I just didn’t want to do life today and I slept in... until 1pm. I ended up missing “deadlines” I made for myself to complete things and I’m so fucking behind in life now. I wake up to a number of emails letting me know and I just want to crawl into a hole and die. There’s just so much pressure coming from everywhere and it’s making my head spiral.

He and one of my other coworkers were talking about how great being a kid/teen was compared to adulthood. You don't have to worry about bills, or going hungry, you feel safe and loved. 

But I have always in a way worried about those things( may be not the bills). I went hungry at the end of the month because food stamps only covered so much, my parents would yell and scream at each other and I didn't feel safe, my little brother has autism and needed a lot of help so I questioned my parents love compared to him. 

I was also extremely depressed from middle school on. I latter became suicidal. I didn't get help in till I was an adult because my parents didn't believe teens could really be depressed.

I am so much happier as an adult.I am happy for once. I'm on meds and have friends who get me I have a job I love most of the time. I have an amazing girlfriend. I am happy. 

I don't know why I wrote this. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest because I didn't know what to say to my coworkers. I just kinda nodded and agreed.

Im 20 and it has taken me a while to realize that I could cry 10 million tears and nothing good would happen.

The question now is how. How can I adapt and deal with this life that was forces on me?
My plan is distraction. Never stop searching for it. I count myself lucky for not living in a time with little tech. I have the internet. 
My distractions:
-learning to play guitar
-programming

Thats it. It's not much, but baby steps right? Lucky for me, I found 1 thing that awakens something in me: music. I'm not outgoing at all and try to draw as little attention as possible but it turns out I feel a burst of endorphins when I learn a song on guitar. I guess it's a sense of accomplish because it shows me that Im at least capable of this one thing.

And now Im trying to sing. I sound absolutely terrible, but when I feel passion overtake me, I just do it.

This isnt to say most of my waking moments arent still agonizing, but the point is that these things help. Maybe something solid and good will come out of them. I only picked up guitar 10 months ago and have been practicing very leisurely. Maybe something will be different this time next year?

Point being, find something that whisks you out of the present and makes you feel foreign, strong passion. I know one of the problems lots of us have is that we literally don't have interest in anything anymore. But try this: Think of a time you were happy. It may be when you were a kid. 

Take whatever made you happy then, whether it was music, a show, or some singular thing like your dad picking you up.

Take this and make something. Put it on the internet. Reddit could be a good ppace to start. See what people say and go from there.",depression

There are days I actually feel really good, but then there are days I have just one wish and that is ceasing to exist. Sometimes I feel like a regular person, living a regular, ignorant life, marching towards the inevitable void, that death represents. 

But boy, let me tell you that ignorance is bliss. Sometimes it hits hard. I call it ""it"", because it's a feeling I can't describe with words. It comes out of nowhere and instantly shatters every last peace of happiness in my consciousness. Then I unwillingly wander to the darkest corners of my mind, the rotten core of my suffering. Suicidal thoughts are becoming more frequent, loneliness is unbearable and I'm just trying to hold on, even if I know deep down, that it has no meaning whatsoever. Nothing has a meaning anymore. I'm trapped in this purgatory until the eternal void gets me.

713,t3_diha5o,"I can't commit to killing myself, but I also can't really commit myself to making my life better","I don't know. I just can't take control of my life. I don't really want to if I'm being honest. I just kind of want to run away fro my responsibilities. Even the simple stuff. 

I guess I'm just growing to appreciate the sheer gravity of the impact my choices have on my life. The choices I make dictate whether or not I even get to eat the next day. That thought has been fucking me up lately. I feel like I'm slipping into this animalistic state, where thoughts concerning the stuff I need to survive just causes me a bunch of anxiety. I don't know. It's like I still can't accept shit for what it is. If I knew I was facing death or if I became disabled/deformed from some accident, I just know I would handle it badly. Going into dark thoughts about fuck the world and everyone else, asking why it has to be this way. I don't know. Kind of the same background thoughts I already have about life without all of that horrible shit I guess. 

I just don't know man. I feel like life is just too stressful in general, as of there is no room to just not worry about anything, or think about anything. It's like life itself demands so much of us and I'm not sure I can really use my time here on Earth to do anything with my life really. I feel like I'm just not capable of accomplishing my goals and I just can't. Stick. To. A . Plan. The reward system or whatever it is in my brain is too fucked up for me to be able to set a realistic plan, follow it in a timely major, or feel good about and thus confident in the plan at all, in any sense.

I don't know. It's like, real life doesn't allow any breathing room, unless you are able to provide yourself with it. I don't know man. What can I provide myself with? I don't know. I don't feel all that confident in myself and I don't know if I ever really will. I can't pull myself out of it. Doesn't matter what I accomplish. 

Just trying to stay mentally present is so draining. I just want to coast and get high, but I can't even smoke now, and things just seem really dark. I find it really difficult to focus on anything in a productive way. I try to set goals like to work out or read but I'm always so slow with it and I constantly feel like my brain is just pulling itself away from the task at hand, whatever it may be, and it's like I'm not cognitively strong enough to to pull myself back in. 

I don't know. I question my own mental abilities all the time. My ability to maintain focus or mindfulness for an extended period of time like maybe an hour max is just so hard. I can't write anything. I can't study things effectively. It's just so hard man. Life is so challenging and I find it so hard to like the challenge. It just feels tiring.  I feel lonely too but I'm too scared to increase my social network. More people you know personally are just more people you are responsible to. Something in my brain just does not like being interpersonally connected or tied to others. Something in my brain just hates human interaction. I hate the challenge of it, I hate having to think about the subtext of reacting to someone a certain way, when I just want it to not mean anything at all, because then you have to save face and deal with the bullshit that I put on myself by coming off the wrong way. Coming off the right way is so much work and mental energy and something in my brain is so put off my emotionally connecting with someone that I just can't welcome what may be a positive interaction. I just feel icky and fake I guess, but if I don't really try, then I just come off as an asshole anyways, or if not an asshole, some other negative thing like bored, stupid, insecure, etc.

Idk. Life makes me tired and I wish I didn't have to think about how I'm going to feed myself (in general) or anything else really, but I'm to weak or scared to accept death. Idk. I feel like every decision I make in some way determines whether or not I end up homeless and on the streets and I just don't want this kind of responsibility. I mean I don't want my teeth falling out because I can't afford toothpaste either...I just don't know. I don't know man. I just want to get high, but the only way to really get out of this is to die, but I don't want to die either. I just can't buck up and be a man. I want to just slip away unaware in my sleep. Please. I don't want to think about what non-existence would feel like, I just want it to happen. I have things I'd like to accomplish in this life, but I'm just not going to. I'm not going to live a comfortable lifestyle owning a home in the city. I'm probably not going to be able to figure out a profitable business. Eh. I just don't know.",depression

716,t3_dijyn3,Only a few years as an adult (21) and I’m so far beyond lost,"I’ve felt empty just about my whole life and really just didn’t realize it. I’ve never at any point in my life felt happy in my current situation always thinking it’ll get better eventually. Always felt ugly as a kid and gained weight continuously then felt fat &amp; ugly all throughout my teenage life thinking the same thing, someday I’ll get my act together and fix all this. Now I’m a few years into college and I really haven’t made much progress at all. I get major anxiety whenever anyone asks what I’m studying or if I’m in school because I can’t even bring myself to explain my situation it just sounds so hopeless. “I don’t really know, I’m kinda in between things and not entirely sure what I wanna do and don’t want to rush anything”. This is always followed by praise for being smart and taking things slow when in reality I genuinely have no clue what I’m doing and every semester whenever time to schedule for the next semesters classes starts rolling around (It’s more or less that time now for me) I get so scared thinking about what to sign up for as it seems completely hopeless and a waste of time. I hate the conversation of “what’s your passion? What do you like doing?” Because there’s not really anything I’m so passionate about I’ve felt empty my whole life. The worst part is that I come from a doctor family and I’ve had it really nice up until recently. The best way I can describe it is that I’ve been playing this game through the free trial without even knowing it and that trial ended when I turned 18 and now I truly don’t feel like I can handle this. I grew up on the wealthier side but wasn’t aware my parents marriage was rocky from the start. Both parents came from overseas and my dad didn’t want my mom pursuing work or an education. He’s a great dad and provided and all but both parents really made things harder overall. They got a nasty divorce and got the whole community Involved and my dad lost his job for practicing a field of medicine he wasn’t trained in (seriously who the hell does that??) and that lead to him giving up on his health and now he’s mostly bed ridden all the time. He was always diabetic and he eventually came down with an infection in his foot he didn’t bother to take care of until it was so bad he got gangrene. This was all before the divorce but my mom had clearly hated her life for so long. I used to wonder why she’d constantly wake up in a bloody murder rage and it made more and more sense as I got older. (My siblings and I weren’t abused by any means, she would just wake up furious and It just made more sense why as I got older.) They finally get divorced and my dad becomes a total psycho saying we can’t see her or talk to her and that was just a total mess from both sides. It’s been years since all of this took place, as a family we have no source of income and my dad really hasn’t even been a source of advice but now I especially don’t bother trying to talk to him about these kinds of things. We are a religious family and whenever I mention feeling anxious and lost he just spews having faith in God and that he’ll solve everything. I always want to ask him if he thinks God helped him...as I’m writing this he’s on the couch hallucinating in and out of sleep talking to himself (his health is so bad). My mom was in town not too long ago (when they got divorced she moved overseas and I’ve seen her twice since she left) and I wanted to ask her the same thing and sure enough I get the same response. “No matter how much God pushes you away keep asking for his guidance and he’ll help” that saying alone made me realize my mom is an uneducated fool who is totally useless in me figuring out what to do with my own life. I’ve never been happy I’ve always felt so broken on the inside. I don’t know what to do and every time I think of something I’m hopeful for a whopping 30 seconds before I start feeling depressed and that I’m not good enough and can’t do anything. Recently I’ve been wondering why on earth I was placed here. I never agreed to this I never could imagine ever wanting to live in this life it’s so horrible. I’d love nothing more than to end it all but I do believe in heaven and hell and really the only thing that seems worse than this life is fire and brimstone for all eternity. At this point I have faith in my religion solely for the idea that this life can’t possibly be so empty. We just live to go to school and work and get married and have kids just because everyone else does then we die? That sounds awful. I have no money to my name and haven’t made much of an impact at all whatsoever and I’m so afraid a few years are going to go by and I’m still gonna be in this same spot feeling this same way. I’ve already felt this way for so long and it’s just gotten worse as I go along. How the hell am I supposed to have faith in God when he made this mess happen???? Why couldn’t they have stayed together? Why couldn’t he have at least kept his health or his job? Did he really have to lose his job health and marriage? Why is my mom completely useless to me? Why couldn’t she have worked or something so at the very least she’d be a source of knowledge and wisdom??? Every time I talk to my friends I get the same showily spiel about how I have my health and people have it worse and to just find a hobby and make a living out of it and go out and socialize and network my way into a better situation. I know all of those things are helpful in some form or another but honestly speaking I don’t even want to continue I want it all to end so badly. If you’ve read this far thanks it means a lot. I don’t care to hear about suggestions for making things better I’m just saving anyone thinking about that the trouble of even bothering. I downloaded this app a few hours ago solely to read about other people feeling depressed and empty and that kinda made me want to vent a bit to strangers on the internet.

He thinks good wives listen more and speak less. He can verbally abuse me and insult me as much as he likes but I can't ask him why he does something. My daughter is headstrong and a rebellious teenager. She responds well to short sentences too. Basically, I have no one to whom I can vent out.

Here too on Reddit, most of my comments get deleted by mods because they overlook rules. When I share experiences, people are quick to say that I am making it all up. One person even pointed out that it's funny that 'abusiverelationships' is my number 1 subreddit. All I want is to know how people cope up with being put down all the time.

One wanted to apologise because he now knows what it feels like to be heartbroken.  The other owed me money and wanted to meet to return it. 

The heartbroken one, was a toxic relationship.  I was very damaged because of him.  Him bringing it up brought me back to that time, and I felt like I did when I was with him. 

The other took it one step further and talk about what went wrong in our relationship because (according to him) ""if we meet again in the future, and neither of us are with partners, I don't want old problems to come back up"", except he didn't actually recognize his fault in the ending of our relationship, and instead blamed other people.

A bit of background I am a college student who is engaged to an amazing girl and I’m almost ready to get out and start a life on my own. Every year around September-October I began getting more and more depressed. I have felt this since I was younger when I was abused around this time in middle school. 

My freshman year of college I worked on myself lost weight ate right and made friends. Since then I turned 21 I have drunk a lot and I eat a lot to cover my emotions. I struggle with addictions and to fight those I eat. I am over weight to the point I feel it hurts my personal wellbeing and those around me. Yet when I try to fix it like any addict I look for a reason not to. My partner has also an emotional past and I put hers before mine only hurting our relationship. 

I don’t know how to get help. I can’t push myself to sometimes I can but I feel so tired I never go through with it. My social psychology professor at my university says a person has to feel truly depressed to find help for themselves. Does that mean I’m not depressed? I want help I just don’t have the motivation to get it. I don’t want to be someone’s burden anymore I just don’t know where to start.

723,t3_dijsgc,I hate mirrors.,"Today was the first time in weeks that I actually looked at myself. I can't stand looking at my body. My arms, my face, my chest, my hips. All of it, I wish I could do away with. I put my toothbrush and my other toiletries next to the kitchen sink so I could avoid seeing myself. At least I have a reason to go in the kitchen now. I can't put something up to cover to cover the mirror because I have a roommate. 

Today while looking in the mirror, I noticed a bruise the size of a nickel on my arm. It's odd to me, because I can't remember the last time I had a bruise. I can't stop looking at it. I'm wearing long sleeves now so I wouldn't be able to. I'm also cold all the time so maybe that's the real reason I'm wearing them. Or, maybe its because I don't want anyone to see my disgusting fat arms. 

What am I even doing here? I don't belong. Everyone is so smart or talented or motivated. Or at the very least, attractive. I'm none of those things. What am I? I don't even fucking know but probably not a college student. I hate seeing people. I hate seeing people be happy, and I know that's bad for me to feel. I don't hate them, I just don't understand them. Everyone around me are leagues ahead of me, and it pains me to see them.

Maybe I should just blind myself. So I could stop seeing people being happy. At least then I won't be bothered by mirrors.",depression

-started Cymbalta in September day after my Birthday. The stresses that have been  balled up and festering caught up with me and i cracked, and shut down basicaly on autopilot. 

- I did it more so to shut everyone up, i told my wife today the anxiety and depression isnt gone and knew id never be fixed by it. My family uses it against me  and say shit like ""oh calm down"", ""oh dont get crazy on me just hush"" ""oh maybe they can up your meds"" ""oh its working for you, your calmer"".

- No, its not working. All the agonizing thoughts and what just feels like yelling and screaming and 10000 conversations/thoughts/worries/possibilities/suicidal thoughts/doomed feelings ect ect ect are all in my head going a million miles an hour they just dont escape thanks to this medication. I dont sleep but a few hours a night (a person was genuinely suprised at how im not sleeping well after experiencing my calmer outside appearance.) I said its worse.

- The physical struggles with a degenerative spine and arthritis and other chronic pains are bad enough but i feel as though my brains excepted failure.

So to end this rant, im not getting better but everyone else seems to tolerate me better.

725,t3_dijrgi,I'm approaching my final month.,"Today I've done a lot of reflecting on the things that made me happy in the past, experiencing those things, and getting nostalgia from them.

726,t3_dijqjg,Im just posting this here cause im so lonely and have no one to rant to.,"This is just a rant. As the title says im so lonely i have no one to rant to or talk to. Even though theres people around me, i dont trust them enough with my issues and im scared of being judged. 

Anyways, every since coming home from university for our reading week/period i've cried everynight because i feel so lonely. Im desperate for friends here. During university, im rooming with my girlfriend. And shes the only thing i have. Yes we were able to make one friend and hes the other only thing i have though i dont trust him as much as her. Anyways, my point is, my girlfriend is all i have as a ""friend"". Im surpised that i am even able to have myself a girlfriend. I dont have anyone else to talk to or hang out with. Coming back home made me realise how lonely i am. In univeristy, i have her to talk to everyday but at home, im isolated in my room. I know she has her own friends too that she hangs with but i dont have anyone. I havent talked to anyone from highschool since graduating. Today we got to hang out and its most likely the only time im going out for the duration of our break. Even though it was one day, i felt so happy being around her cause shes all i have as a person to talk to. I dont message anyone else but her. I dont hang out with anyone but her. But i know she cant always be there for me. I get so excited when i receive a text from her and espeically from someone else. 

I realized this whole rant is just how amazing it feels to have one person in your life but also so sad cause if she goes one day, i have no one else. I feel so lonely on the inside. Im desperate for friends but im afraid of everyone. I try to talk to people but i always assume that dont like it so it drags me away from them. Im sorry for the long and weird post and if anyone reads it, thanks for listening.",depression
727,t3_dilvlo,all i want to do is help the hurt,"(sorry for spelling mistakes, i’m not the best at writing paragraphs while crying)

hiii so I know for a fact that I am not going to pass high school since ive been using most of my time in music. Most of my songs have something to do with depression, playing these songs help me cope with my suicidal thoughts. i don’t know if this is a me thing but i can physically feel my songs, the texture, and color. my biggest influence is Nirvana, the difference is I want to play acoustic (i have a electric guitar but i have trouble singing with it because i’ve established a really deep connection with my acoustic. she is more or less my best friend). my uncle tells me I play well and he can see me having a future in music, but im contemplating if it’s worth living on. i’ve always felt like i never belonged in this world, i feel like an outcast almost all the time, i don’t even think my friend wants to be my friend. for a while the only way i dealt with this was by listening to nirvana, i felt much safer inside when listening to them. that’s what i want to do with my music, i want the person listening to feel safe, that it’s okay to cry, it’s okay to feel sad, it’s okay to feel like you’re an outcast. i want to hold their hand and tell them it’s all okay and so much more stuff. no one who has been hurt deserves to be left in the dust deserves to walk where the sun don’t ever shine. this is my driving force in life, there is nothing in this world i would rather do then make music. i’m afraid im not going to make it.

729,t3_dibjg2,Struggling with my wife's depression,"I'm really fucking tired. So, so tired. I try to support her, I really do. But it's really difficult. Especially since I'm still recovering from depression myself. I miss having a healthy and happy marriage, where everything doesn't revolve around depression, anxiety and paranoia. I just miss doing stuff. Going somewhere. Talk, without every conversation ending with my wife saying it's a really bad day and I'm just quiet because I don't know what the fuck to say anymore.

I'm tired of her not trusting me, tired of her paranoia. Tired of her being afraid that I'll have her put in a hospital. 

I'm tired of being afraid for her. Tired of dreading going home because I don't know what I'll come home to. Tired of being sick with fear every time I go to work, because I don't know if it's the last time I see my wife. 

I'm tired of dreading going home because I know exactly what awaits. Another night of sitting on the couch barely talking because she's having another bad day and I'm too exhausted to ask what's wrong. 

And I hate myself for feeling this way. For looking for excuses not to go home. I feel like the worst husband ever. But it's really fucking hard sometimes. It's really hard being a bystander. It's really hard being a relative or SO sometimes.",depression

732,t3_dijf22,It's my birthday today...,"Another year of a worthless existence.

I should probably introduce myself, I turned 22 today and I suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I have failed every psuedo coming-of-age ritual from learning to ride a bike to having sex. I live in a family member's house and feel like a burden every day, and feel like I'm invading their space/life all the time. I don't have a job and with my mental state don't think I could handle having one. I've never really had drive, ambition, or passion for anything in life; I also didn't go to college because of this.

Lately my depression and anxiety have gotten far worse. This is my fault I understand, but I have found myself incapable of fixing it. I had a job for about a year but I quit when it became to much physically as well as mentally. Since then, for a year and a half I have not had a job, no outside life at all. Recently I told someone about my depression, that it had gotten so bad I ""wanted to die"", truthfully most days I want to stop existing. The response I received was ""suicide doesnt solve anything, it just makes your problems go away and leaves everyone else with pain."" I never mentioned suicide, I understand it isn't much different, but for me the distinction is important and so the response made me feel unheard even more. I have determined that personally this decision to say it to someone else was probably a grasp for help as I've have discovered I cannot do it myself.

Some days I wake up and try to go back to sleep, and some days when I get up I feel like an empty shell, I've even felt as if I returned to my body and was halfway through making breakfast. Some people describe it as drowning, but drowning means substance and there is nothing, just an empty void, empty pressure, nothing.

I have no job, no money, no insurance so I dont know how to seek professional help. Besides my depression and anxiety tend to steer me away from things like this. Like a force leading me toward distractions, procraztinating until I've forgotten it or given up. The only things that help are the stories I build in my mind and watching TV. I enjoy watching TV I can sink myself into the show and disconnect from reality. I am an idealist, or at least that's what I call it, I love the idea behind things, romanticzations of them, but the reality never matches up. I've tried many times to write, the idealism, romanticism, and ""daydreams"" seem like the perfect match but my lack of drive and passion always seem to lead to a halt.

I have felt like this my entire life, I cant remeber a day when I didn't have anxiety or depression. I've been told many times that I needn't worry about so much as I have my whole life ahead of me, if my whole life is just this and I've barely begun then that isn't very inspiring. I am lost, afraid, and alone. I build up a ""mental space"" by doing things I enjoy that disconnect me from my reality, but it's getting harder to maintain and it's taking longer to reach a point of normalcy. As such it is becoming harder to appear ""fine"" and to keep some thoughts/emotions internal. I need help.

I do apologize for the length and if any of this sounded weird, but I just wanted to get some of this out.",depression
733,t3_dijdis,22y old with depression.,"Hey there chaps. Been undiagnosed with depression since I was 12 (not even sure how it began) but apparently it was mild at the time, years later thanks to some not so nice events, school problems and family related business I was sent to a psychologist first who in span of 3 months sent me a to psychiatrist where eventually I was diagnosed with a moderately-severe depression right off the bat where I also got meds to help battle it etc. Well things were OK, I was a dead inside zombie just going through life as a teen, nothing special, having social anxiety, hating school and life in general, only finished high school because of my mum. Never really liked society either, always was a nihilist really and still am. I don't really see a purpose in life except one time which I will get to in a bit. Even though I hated all my time spent in high school, I remember that I had ambitions and some plans of what to do in life. Now I have none of that anymore, I couldn't care less about 95% of things I tried doing. Anyway, around when I was 17, I had a short ""relationship"" with a girl I fancied, but only took 3 months, , she broke it off for unknown reasons, it wasn't pleasant but such is life at least it was short. I was back to being uninterested but hopeful that theres something in life. About a year later when I was over 18 I met a girl that I talked to for a while, turned out she loved games (oh yeah, I am a huge gamer, well used to be now its more like a thing to pass time, not much excitement from them), we clicked instantly but started dating after 2 months, It changed me a lot for the better, I actually became kind of content and semi happy in days when I spent time with her, gave me a proper purpose, we had fun, life seemed OK and like its worth living. We were together for almost over a year before she... cheated on me with her ex bf. I talked to him man to man and turned out she was a bit of a b... and not all who she seemed, so he broke it off with her too and she ended up single. It broke me, first time I attempted suicide but snapped out of it because I thought of my mum who loves me and how it would crush her( along with some close friends I still have) so I didn't do it. I told it all to my doc who understood etc. upped my meds (didn't do anything other than make me feel less of everything). Still having a slither of hope left I went to try and get to uni, was accepted to the best uni in the country but after 3 months I left (I had around a year break from school because school always stressed me out due to everyone placing huge hopes in me). I realised that it wasn't for me, at least not that kind (programming etc.) it made my life even more stressful and worse and almost drove me to do it again (suicide) but instead I just quit and got out. I tried a few things in the next half a year but nothing could grab my attention anymore, almost every desire, every goal was gone by that point. Right now I am totally lost, uninterested, a damned meteor could hit the earth and I couldn't care less about anything right now. All I do is wake up and play games or stay in bed all day (its 50/50) but at least I talk to a couple of friends almost daily on voice chat. Sometimes though, my friends get me to go out with them (few more including those I talk to on voice) maybe once a month, it doesn't do much but at least I guess I am outside and not always in the same room doing nothing or gaming etc. I don't even know what I should do anymore, nothing seems to matter much to me lately too, just surviving every day, having hope and one desire to get out of this, I hate being like this, its so energy draining. Not enjoying anything I used to way, way back when I was a kid and how it was when I was in love. Things just look black and white. I used to work out, I kind of still do just so I don't get fat and weak muscles which would make it even worse so theres that. I am on meds right now too, my docs all know but so far its been hard. Especially past few months it keeps getting worse. I also forgot to mention that I basically thing about death and how much better it would be for everyone if I was gone almost daily, ofc I will not kill myself for a few reasons at least not yet, not while I still have hope. Writing all this makes me shed tears because it makes me think about life and all that.... its not fun, all I can feel all day is void in my heart and pain and just a weird feeling near my heart that feels crushing. I don't even know if this rant makes much sense etc. right now I have to say I had a few shots of alcohol, even though I am on meds. People used to tell me I am so smart and so intelligent yet I only feel dumb and like a huge failure. I have had therapy for some time, it did nothing. Meds do almost nothing too.

I also have to mention, both my parents are disabled for past 15 years or so. Dad having his heart working at like 38% due to illnesses (non treatable in his case). My mum has one of her nerves on the right side of her body stripped of the fat around nerves which basically without meds gives her pain that makes her unable to do anything but hey, thanks to meds she can even work kind of (the nerve in question is brachial plexus, basically a bunch of nerves, it happened during a botched surgery that saved her life but fluffed up that) it is untreatable apart from having strong meds that basically lessen the pain a lot etc. She has a work she loves atm so thats fine. We are not really financially struggling but all I can see around me is just misery and pain, that life does not care who you are, that life will fk you up no matter what. Theres plenty of other similar stuff that happened since I was 12 to close family members. Maybe it scarred me a bit. I don't know.

I really just want this to end, all I can feel is emotional pain or nothing. I can sometimes laugh at stupid jokes and so on but outside of that, when I am alone even if I find something to distract me, it all comes slowly back and its just... so hard. I am going to be 23y soon-ish, I am still young too so maybe there is a chance that life gets better. Or thats what I tell myself  but I really hate life right now so much. I also due to that incident with the girl and few other ones during my life have a dislike for humanity and people so I am not too social nor do I care to be.

Thank you for reading this if you did, even if it didn't make much sense or was weird/hectic but my thoughts tend to be disorganised. I needed to get it out of my chest. Also I have not said exactly everything in this post, only some parts of the whole, the important parts or so I think... I also do not really care what people think about any of this. I have too much on my mind lately.

Excuse any grammatical errors etc. but I am not a native english speaker + have a few shots in me so they are bound to be mistakes.

735,t3_dijct8,Why does depression come in waves?,"Hi all, I am brand new to this thread. I have been taking Wellbutrin (bupropion) for my depression for almost two years now. I have always felt like it has worked really well for me, but I’ve really really been struggling lately. 

To sum it up, my dad just died a horrific death (just a long, painful way to go) after being sick for years, I moved to a new town two hours away to starts graduate school and get a new direction for my life, but that’s left me completely lost and homesick.

I’ve started a romantic “relationship” (we are not official or exclusive but not seeing other people) with a guy I’ve been best friends with for eight years. I feel like I’m in love with him, but I can’t even express my true feelings because he just got out a two year relationship and I know he wouldn’t be ready. He also unknowingly gave me herpes (HSV-1 cold sores but to my genitals) and its like all this has piled on me to the point I feel like I’m going to break.

Idk if my medicine isn’t working anymore or because of said recent events, but my depression really eats at me at night to the point I don’t sleep anymore. Having panic disorder doesn’t help either.

You know what fuck everything! Does my life really come to a point where ranting on the internet is better then telling someone. Maybe yeah but that’s all I ever got. I don’t feel I have anyone anymore. Parents ha who are you joking. My dad when he found out bout my depression he cared for a day and then went back into his old habits treating me like shit again. My mom she’s fucking narcissistic she ain’t ever gave a damn about me and if she is. It’s a lie or it’s just pitty. She been telling me things to make me feel worse about who I am so she feels better. There was a point in time in fact multiple points in time. I would get my book bag (this is when I was 9) contemplating if I should run away from the hell I’m in. The only thing that ever came to mind was and who would care about you out there? Where is the money? How will you eat out there? You don’t got any friends that would take u in either? those times I would stay up until 12 putting in my book bag things a run away would take. I ended up sitting on the floor after finishing and crying myself to sleep. Oh right let’s not forget dad said out loud to you and your brother he doesn’t give a shit about you and he never wanted you and that he doesn’t love you. Ah yeah you want proof how about this. Beat because you ate chips in the room and nearly died from it but nooo I was fucking quiet so dad doesn’t go to jail so then your mom who doesn’t care about you anyways suffer. And for my mother did I really seem like a fucking slut to you when I was 12 because I said I had a boyfriend the first thing you say is your a slut. WITH WHAT FUCKING GUYS. Let’s not forget lil old me pretending to be okay and once I left that door and down the street I cried my way to school. Wiping my eyes and walking in and not even in the classroom. NOT EVEN CARING ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT. And not letting anyone in. Because god forbid they bully you again for more years because you got upset and told them. Let’s not forget that being sexually assaulted means that she’s a prostitute and that she asked for it. Let’s not forget that I try my Fucking best to pass and all I get is c’s. And just because I can’t be like my classmates or your friends kids that she is garbage and can’t even do what normal kids do. WELL IM FUCKING SORRY IM NOT Einstein.  Let’s not forget about the time I got cheated on and got the person who said they loved you until they would die. They didn’t give a shit about her anyways. So I wasn’t even good enough for that but I stayed. Why am I the one taken advantage of? Hmmm I am always there for you all of my friends yet? When I need it you don’t need to hear from me you don’t want me to ruin your mood? Oh I’m busy? Well maybe I shouldn’t be there for you either but it’s not like I’m going to drop you anyways. I honestly can’t breathe anymore from writing this. It hurts knowing I have been wanting death to happen to me since I was 7. I’m 14 it’s been 7 years living with burden and pain. It fucking hurts. Not to mention when I beg for help. No one listened to me. “Don’t worry we will give you a therapist”. MY ASS WHERE ARE THEY ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS! I’m soo done with all that bullshit I rather rant on Reddit then some bitch ass therapist who never came. I’m sorry for ranting. If your still here thank you for caring enough about me.,depression
740,t3_dijb0p,I'm concerned for my cousin,"Hello. I'm writing this because I need to get this off my chest and maybe get some insight so I know I'm not just overreacting.

My cousin is 16. She's is 3 years younger than me but we've been so close since we were children that we are practically sisters.

My cousin is the oldest girl in a family with 5 kids, including her. ((3 boys and 2 girls)) She has always had to look after her younger brothers who both have autism. She's looked after them so much to the point where she is a mom to her brothers and her mom has done little to no parenting. Because of this my cousin has had no childhood.

When my cousin was younger she had a notebook where if she was feeling angry or upset at somebody she would write all her feelings in that book. Unfortunately her mom found the book and burned it. This is where I believe my cousin first started to have depression.

Then a couple years ago. My cousin's older brother had a horrible accident. He was burning leaves when he was horribly burned from his chest all the way up his neck. He survived but is scarred all over and has had major surgeries. This only worsened my cousin's depression.

However my cousin's family doesn't believe in depression so she is unable to get any help or medication.

She's always been able to come to me because I have depression and I understand her and her feelings the best. Everytime I see her we sit in her room and have long talks.

But I worry about her. She's constantly being emotionally neglected by her family. She struggled to maintain friendships because she goes home and has to do so many chores as well as look after her younger siblings AND do her high school homework.

She's given up things she loves because she can never have the freedom to do what she loves. There was even talks of her not even going to high school so that she could be home to take care of her younger siblings.

So am I overreacting or should I be concerned?",depression

I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for quite a while, but I have had a couple things happen in my life lately that made it 10 times worse and since I dont really have anyone to talk to I thought I would see a therapist. I just dont know how to go about finding one. Do you ask you primary care doctor or just google therapist nearby and just make an appointment?",depression
742,t3_dihmzi,Hello There. (Sorry for the long story),"Hi, my name is Lyndz. I've been pretty bad for the past 3 or so years. When I was is 4th grade my grandmother passed away. That really messed me up. I still feel bad about not spending as much time with her as I should have. Then, about 6 months later, my family's dog past away. His name was Jake and he was a 13 year-old golden retriever. Because I was 10 back then, this really killed me. Then, when I was in 6th grade, I got made fun of and called ugly and fat. I always was ashamed of how I looked, I'm one of the biggest in my grade. My mom also yelled at me a lot more. She never got physical, but she would say horrible things. One day, I was at home on a Saturday, being lazy. My mom came in and was mad at me because I didn't unload the dishwasher. She then threatened to send me to a boarding school, an orphanage, or a children's home. This crushed me. Still to this day, she says she never did that. So one day, when my dad was the only one home, I went downstairs, just to look for something. He asked me if something was wrong, and that's when everything came out. I had a full on mental breakdown in front of him, and I don't regret it. I've never been clinically diagnosed with depression, but have with anxiety. I take a low dose of medicine for it, and I decided to look up what it was, now that I've been on it for 2 years. It also helps with depression. About 6 months ago, it got really awful. I would harm myself with safety pins, but my parents never noticed. Again, I had a mental breakdown with my dad the only one home. He suggested I go to a therapist, but I said no. My mom found out about it, and is trying to help me through it. I'm getting better, but I'm thinking about doing therapy; I don't know yet.

744,t3_diljwo,I felt a relief,"I always feel tired. I don't go outside much, tbh I haven't gone outside for last 25 days. My father was angry at me for being too lazy. I haven't told them ever about my depression.

Today he told me to go for some groceries to buy. I felt more tired the moment when he told me this, i felt irritated. He pushed me hard to go and shouted. I was almost on the verge of crying but somehow I resisted. He insisted me to go on bicycle, as because i have gained some weight and been skinny fat for 2 years now.

I lost myself and angrily grabbed the keys of my motorbike instead and went away, i didn't listened to him, he was yelling at me to opt for cycle.

As i went outside i felt a little bit of relief in myself. It was not the happiness but it was some relief, as compared to me lying on the bed whole day. 

Maybe I was distracted from my actual thoughts by looking at people, sky, the road, busy mall etc.

The thing I noticed is
1) I was tired already
2) when my father told me to go for shopping. I felt more tired and even got irritated.
3) BUT the moment i stepped outside i felt light in myself.

Adulthood looks like misery, a drudge-filled slog until you collapse and die of exhaustion. No friends, no lovers, no family, just work and death. Why not shoot myself now? Blow my brains out? Why would I want to meet such a fate? This is, after all, the fate of much of my generation. 

I was a fucking loser in college, I’ve barely dated, barely go out, had few friends, etc. I’m a fucking failure. If my son was what I am I’d beat him every single day. I’d beat him until he was unconscious. Until calling the cops on me is the only sensible thing to do. I’d feel such hatred and disgust and disappointment towards him. I’d disown him. But see, my son would never be me, because I’d discipline him his whole life.

Not that it even matters. I’ll never have a relationship, I’ll never have a family, fuck, if I had a gun on hand right now I wouldn’t even see my 23rd birthday. There is no hope, none, in my whole life I’ve never seen any hope, just disappointment. My hope will come when I develop the willpower and funds to kill myself. 

My life was a fucking mistake, I don’t want to see what comes next, the past eight years were fucking awful and for both HS and college people said things would get better, now I know that death is better and it’s all I desire.",depression

750,t3_dild78,"Depression, anxiety, don't really know. But it seems to have started at the wrong time","Hello,

I've been googling around, trying to find an answer to how I'm feeling right now. Don't really know if it's depression, anxiety or just simply that I'm having a bad time.

I left my last job at the end of July. I've spent two years there, first as a helpdesk tech and then as a sysadmin (who had to keep doing helpdesk work and also my new tasks). We started a project that had me working around 12-14 hours from Monday to Friday, and then another 10 hours on-call during Saturdays, for August 2018 to mid January 2019. During that time, I almost didn't do anything besides working. I usually had one or two bad mornings during the month, crying and not wanting to leave for work. But I went to work, and as I can remember things, I was totally functional. A colleague had to leave two months for depression, because we had a lot of pressure over our shoulders. And some others got surprised that I've managed to keep up with the work. I was a bit surprised too.

On July, I finally had an interesting job offer. I'm doing full sysadmin work right now, have Fridays ""free"" for my own projects at the office, no on-call, no weekend work...almost like a dream come true. I'm on probation for six months, but even if it doesn't end well, now I can be sure that I won't have a lot of problems getting another job. But, instead of enjoying how things are going, this week I've been crying a lot every morning. I wake up, prepare to leave for work, and when I'm alone at the office I feel like the whole world is crashing over me. The rest of the day tends to go well as long as I'm working, and during the evenings everything starts again. I've stopped doing things that I liked, and that I wanted to have time for while on the other job.

Is there an explanation for all of this? Or should I try to get some help, before it starts to get worse.",depression
751,t3_dild4c,Depression is stable?,"Lately I've been feeling pretty okay as far as emotional stability. If I had to guess why I'm feeling okay it would have to be books and The Walking Dead.

Lately I've been into graphic novels and trying to catch up on The Walking Dead series. I guess I have my mind so occupied that I'm feeling okay. Last summer I read like three books and I think what triggered my intrest in books again was that my cousin pointed out a graphic novel that my favorite artist worked on, I bought it and read it.

Unfortunately I have an uneasy feeling that this is not going to last long. That pretty soon I'll be back to my same old depressed POS self. Gotta enjoy it while it last.",depression

I’ve been depressed ever since I can remember. My earliest memories are praying that God would take me in my sleep. 

I recently realized that a lot of my depression has been repressed dysphoria. I came out as trans (FtM) and since then, I’ve become homeless, lost my job, gone no contact with my parents, and have nothing to my name. No money, no car, nothing.

My life is a never ending shitstorm of abuse, neglect, trauma, and unfortunate events. Never. Ending.  I’m 29 and I still can’t get my shit together enough to function in society like a normal human being. 

It would have been better for everyone if I’d never been born. I don’t have the balls to kill myself. I’ve had the intent and the means so many times and only once did I follow through and then it didn’t work, but every other time I couldn’t do it.  But if I could go back in time and prevent my whole life from ever having happened... that I’d do in a heartbeat. That I’d do, no matter what it took.  Even if I couldn’t prevent my parents from having me, I’d go back and burn down the hospital I was born in.

I’m on CPAP - that doesn’t seem to be working, I’ve got sexual side effects from the venafalaxine/bupropion regime I’m on, started with my celexa regime in 2002 but I am also not attracted to my wife anymore.  I dream about girls from my past I’ll never see again.  My pay is shit, everyone continuously tells me I’m lazy.  As much as I fight to believe in a God, I still think deep down I’m an atheist.  I had a daughter in June (from IV) and she makes me smile, but I never see her because of work.  I fucking hate people too.  I feel like I’m surrounded by retards.  I think about death a lot more than I used too.  I think about having a heart attack and where that would leave my child and my family.

You said you've learned to swim before but you were lying. If it's sink or swim you're barely treading water.

All you got today you take as a confirmation of your paranoia and now you'll turn to your instincts of pushing them away. Or are you just your dramatic self as always? Or is that at the core of it anyways. They don't trust you, they don't like you. You got to see a small sliver of what one of them really thinks. You know that can't be isolated. They've fared without you before. They'll do it again, happily.

  


Do you need new friends? Or are you just a burden either way? Things don't change. Maybe you should do it this time. You've threatened your departure before. Do it this time. What do they lose? What do you gain? Not that it matters. You'll never be what you want to be and therefore to you you'll never be worth any ones time. They can tell you all they want what you mean but you'll never believe them.

Is it because you know the real you? Or is your perspective so distorted from bending the perspective to look inward that your reality isn't real.

  


What do you want? Other than non-existence.

What is happiness to you. You'll never be able to answer that.

  


Go to sleep, maybe you'll find answers tomorrow. Or maybe tomorrow is just another day of dealing with your actions. Think carefully this time. How many times can you cry wolf. You're a fuck up. You're a headcase.",depression

I got off the phone with her about a half hour ago, telling her I’d call her back in the morning (her evening - she’s in Germany I’m in the states).

762,t3_dil1u0,Positive experiences with therapy? Not sure if I need it or if it will distress me more. Barely holding it together.,"Long story very, very short, my family is falling apart around me. I’m 33, with a history of depression, anxiety, and self-harm (though it was worst in my teens and 20’s.) My father and sister are heavily depressed, with likely borderline personality disorder. Especially my older sister, who has had multiple suicide attempts this year, and has gotten violent with my family before being kicked out. She’s now homeless and vulnerable. My father has pretty recent gambling addiction issues, my mother is ready for divorce after over 40 years of marriage, my only uncles have opiate addiction issues, or legal issues, and I feel the mental health system has failed us all in so many ways. I am the only one in my family who is barely holding it together. I have an amazing marriage and I want to make it last. I am holding down a stable job, but my family’s life circumstances are affecting me so much. 

Thing is, my first experience with therapy was after I was caught self-harming in my teens. The therapist’s take was basically, “Well, sounds like you’re in a no-win situation at home. I don’t blame you for being depressed.” And that’s the only message I got. She started to try to play Monopoly with me... maybe that was a tactic to get me to open up... but that was the day I decided to stop going. She wasn’t taking it seriously enough. I was too old for games, and too young to say so. It was too casual for how awful things are. 

The next and last time, I was about 30 years old. I was having panic attacks from stress and needed guidance on how to deal with the stress from my family life and work. I was recommended by (insert large medical insurance company) to visit a therapist subcontracted by their network. I threw myself into revealing a lot early on, trying to do the work... but she couldn’t remember what I had already told her one appointment to the next. I learned later that she had over twice the amount of patients a practitioner usually has, so cani blame her? That lasted 4 appointments only.

The only way I can describe the feeling is “dirty.” I revealed things to these people... they treated it so casually that I came away feeling so very empty. I can’t do it again. I just feel so ugly after I come away from it because it means nothing to them. Please convince me there are actual breakthroughs. Please tell me it’s worth the money. Please tell me there are therapists out there with insight who try to help their patients. Or just tell me your own frustrations with mental health care options.",depression

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental health issues, and I never saw myself feeling so down. My dad does all the work in my house, and yet I feel like I treat him like shit even though I love him to death. I love my mom as well but every time I talk to her every thing I say just seems like placating to get her to finish because I already know. I always feel like I don't fit in when I do talk to people due to my lack of interaction altogether. I recently started college classes with dual enrollment, but I only have one class out of 3 a week at my physical college, I had taken a math test recently to get a 33% and I honestly thought that I was going to end up getting kicked out of dual enrollment. I only have 4 classes all together and I have all the free time in the world, yet I always get distracted by the smallest thing and it feels like I'm always looking for something else to do even if I 'set my mind to it'. Most of my time is spent catfishing on Discord, I used to just do it for the memes but now I know I'm just doing it for attention.

But on the inside I’m deeply sick with too much pride to get help. For 2 years I’ve slowly become numb to everything around me. I think this was brought on by some pretty traumatic things happening in my family and possibly a little bit of post concussion syndrome, but luckily I had a supportive girlfriend of five years. As I got more and more numb I started to struggle in my relationship and ultimately, it had to end last month as it was no longer fair to the other party. I have no feeling of emotion or happiness. The last 4 days I have not slept. Finally last night was the last straw, having a panic attack so bad I could barely catch a breath between heaving and the uncontrollable shaking. I completely broke down, the weight I’ve been carrying for 2 years became too much for me to hold and I felt my world cave in on me. I decided enough is enough. Time to take back control of my life.

I thought this meant I was no longer depressed. I am motivated now, and I feel like I have something to look forward to every day; but when something good happens, I feel nothing. It feels like my emotions are mostly stunted, and I forget about it every single day until it actually comes time to feel something. I am apathetic about most decisions, and I mistook that for being laid-back. It is the most jarring thing I have ever felt. I have been blessed with so much more than I deserve, and yet I barely feel a thing.

I should’ve sought a psychiatrist to get depression pills earlier. I could’ve dealt with this long ago and kept this girl. But now I’m even more sad, to the point of almost being suicidal. I call crisis lines 24/7 and they don’t understand some just get annoyed.

801,t3_dihtra,I want to stop living,"There are so many factors in my life that have led up to this point, where I don't even hardly leave my house anymore. Maybe I don't wanna stop living. If I killed myself there's no way it's be painless. I want it to be peaceful. And I'm terrified of dying. Maybe I wish I hadn't been born in the first place, never existed. 

Here's where it started.


I've had anxiety my whole life. It's something wired in my brain. There is no cure. In kindergarten, I would cry every day except on the days my mom put me in a dress and my teacher told me she liked my dress. I vaguely remember crying a lot at school then.  I was sexually assaulted when I was six, maybe seven. I figured out my dad was an alcoholic when I was 8 or 9. Since middle school started, everything really went downhill. My dad was arrested for a DUI on Thanksgiving, my grades were falling, my anxiety kicked up and has been worse ever since. I've never found a way to cope.

I used to cut myself. I still find ways to hurt myself when I'm really in a low point (like i am tonight). My dad passed away a year and a half ago because of a stroke. He never got help and it made me feel like he never cared enough about us to do so.

I'm in high school now. I just started my freshman year. I'm a fourteen year old girl who should be worried about my grades, keeping them up, focusing on schoolwork. But that's the problem. School is the problem now. I hate being around people.

Everything is constantly overwhelming. I have constant panic attacks and meltdowns in my classes and I'm disruptive all the time because of it. I'm probably annoying. I'm sure my teachers hate me for it.

Too many expectations, set first by them, and the bar raised high by anxiety and depression. ""You'll never be good enough, just stop trying and kill yourself"". I hate myself. I don't like when people touch me, but I love hugs and that's it. I only allow hugs.

I'm at a point where I can't work up the energy to make myself food other than Ramen or cereal. I only microwave ramen, it's easier that way. I eventually stopped putting clothes away, and I wait until the basket is empty before putting more laundry in the wash. So there's clothes laying all over the floor and I'm too unmotivated to put away clothes.

I have a Halloween party with my friends at my house, so we have a bunch of Halloween decorations in my room. I left the boxes/bags laying on the floor instead of storing them somewhere they wouldn't get tripped on.

My bedroom floor is also littered with water bottles I toss aside when I don't wanna leave my bed. I leave poptart wrappers on my dresser, and I never can work up the energy to put away the cases of the video games I play. 

I don't wanna do anything I enjoy anymore. I have a guitar, a ukulele, and a keyboard. None of which seem fun anymore. I used to find painting fun. I used to find singing fun. I used to find reading fun. The only thing that I count as fun anymore is sleeping so I can dream about a different reality my brain makes for me as an escape. 

The one other thing that helps me cope is my dog. He's the sweetest dog and he has his own bad anxiety so we get along perfectly.

That's it. I have no other coping skills. Nothing I can do during school to help get past the anxiety. No options for school so I'm not breaking down in class. My only options are ""suffer"" and ""suicide"" but my mom would be broken hearted and she already suffers enough. She doesn't need my death as a burden on her shoulders. She once told me ""babies don't belong in coffins"".

I guess that's one reason to keep going.

I'm fourteen. I have my whole life ahead of me. Instead, I spend it crying, sleeping, eating ramen, playing call of duty, Uncharted, Dishonored, and little big planet constantly, and thinking about whether or not it's worth seeing my life through.

I'm sorry this is so long. Please don't be worried about me. Thanks for making it this far.",depression
802,t3_dihs6n,Questioning value of life.,"I've haven't been alive for a long time (24 years to be exact) but everyday i question why am I here? What is the purpose of this thing called life? One day you're here and the next you're gone. Eventually you would be forgotten about people will just move on with their life, so what's really the point of existence? Everything is temporary from family, friends and lovers. Why do we try so hard to be thrown away? I've come to realize everything i do to survive is not the purpose for myself but to take care of my vessel. I wish i can go long periods without being hungry or tired so i won't have to slave until the day i die. I'm as grateful as i can be about my body. Unfortunately there are days like this that make me say i honestly don't want to be a part of this life time. I think about my time ending i get excited and then i get scared, scared of the possibility of being reincarnated or trapped in a timeline.

 i'm unmotivated, i honestly can't stand myself, i'm awkward, cowardly, timid, and have no self confidence. I wasn't meant for this. Feeling like a loser looking at people my age and younger doing more, being more courageous, having a back bone, mentally stronger than i am There are many cases where i feel like people just take me as a joke, probably think i'm crazy based on how i view the world(which is in a very pessimistic view) my natural talent to complain, the ""beautiful"" ways i make mistakes and including my weak voice. There are days where I go 'why have a voice when people talk over me?' I had a co-worker tell me to be more confident. Every time i try to exhibit any kind of confidence i always end up making myself look like a fucking idiotic asshole who don't know shit. I can see many colors but there are many times I see black and white. A very gloomy world. Walking out in open space, while feeling constricted struggling for fresh air. People say there are many things to live for i don't see it. I think they're delusional. They're trying to make themselves and their lives seem more meaningful even they know for sure that they're worthless and can be forgotten about within a year or two.  

I don't know maybe it just me being delusional.  Am I the only one?",depression

I'm a fast learner, yet still almost always I do things the wrong way. And I hate being the only person who knows an answer to a question in the class.

I'm lazy as hell. I can't do anything without someone telling me to do it, or yelling at me to do it. It's mostly the second way.

Lately, I found myself a conformist. I no longer stand my ground, defend my opinions, I just accept what someone else thinks.

Lately I found myself also not able to feel happy. Of course, I laugh at things, but I can't seem to be at least temporarily happy.

I love being roasted. It's just the feeling that someone is somewhat caring about me, or at least notices me.

After witing my letter i sat behind with a feeling that i'm faking everything for attention, even though i haven't told anyone close to me how i'm feeling. It feels like an excuse i'm making up to excuse failing to work on my master thesis.

I have had a plan for ending my life for about a year and half now, but never gone to the step of writing a letter, and yet i don't feel anything (emotional) at the moment. No fear, no sadness, no hapiness, nothing except the thought that it's fake.

807,t3_dihodj,Prescription VS Herbal. Share your experience.,"Hi all,

TL;DR I am curious if anyone has successful treated their depression with Saint Johns Wort and maybe had also treated with an SSRI (at different times) and which you prefer and if you have any insight. 

Long story short. I was diagnosed with GAD many years ago. I was put on lexapro as a teenager and eventually quit cold turkey (I KNOW) when I was 20. I also believe I have some sort of sensory processing disorder that has been left diagnosed as it wasn’t really much of a thing when I was growing up. I’m a really crunchy gal and don’t take prescription meds. 

The past year I have had two bouts of depression and am currently experiencing one. In retrospect I realize I have had many bouts of depression however they seem much more intense as I have gotten older (28F). During my first bout this year I self diagnosed and treated with a St. John’s wort tincture. It seemed to helped.

This go around it got bad enough that I decided to see a functional medicine doctor and despite being a dr who is hesitant to prescribe for any illness (she typically treats with lifestyle, supplements and herbs), we both agreed that Zoloft would be a good option for me. Along with some lifestyle changes.

We’re waiting on bloodwork to come back before getting started.

That said, my boyfriend is encouraging me to look at other options outside of Zoloft but I am still leaning towards taking it as I really feel like it could be the boost I need to get to a place where I can make more lifestyle changes.

I don’t have any friends, but I don’t have the energy for any friendships right now. My life is so boring and all I do is study, work and waste my time seeking attention on Reddit.

Uni days consist of me waking up, doing my make-up (because I CANNOT leave the house without make-up). Then I style my headscarf, which I hate wearing because I think it looks so ugly on me (but I choose to wear it since I can cover all my flaws anyways and my parents would never let me leave without it on). The train commute is draining, I feel like everyone that looks at me sees all my flaws. On average, I take 10 pictures a day in the toilets at uni. Style my hijab again, click. I don’t like it. Style it again, click. I still don’t like it, \*sighs\*, but I have to go to my next class.

As soon as I get home, I take my hijab off and take a pic. Perhaps with some cleavage, because those get the most upvotes and messages on Reddit. I spend my nights talking to strangers on Reddit. I wait till I go to bed to take my make-up off, so that I don’t have to look at my natural face. In bed, I think about what we once were. I cry and cry, it’s my fault we no longer are what we were. But, you have moved on. This is what an average day looks like for me.

What’s more, my father is so strict. He always knows where I am, I can’t go where I want when I want, I don’t have my bank card and he gives me 10 euros a month. He always makes a fuss out of what I wear. Most of you are thinking why not just leave. I can’t. Where do I go? They may hurt me every day, but my family are the only people I have in my life right now. I don’t even do anything to help around the house, my mother does it all. All I do is go to university, be on my laptop and go to work in the weekend.

I feel so empty inside. I wish I could stay in bed all day, but life goes on. I force myself to wake up every morning, back to reality. I really don’t have anything worth living for.

Overall shitty work ethic, no goals, no talents. I enjoy going on jogs or walks during the night or in nature and I do want to become a social worker, though.

Today I looked ahead at my next math lesson, went to the gym for the first time in a while and learned some Hiragana (Japanese characters) as a step to learning Japanese. I feel like this is a great change, but I don't feel happy at all. I feel lonely.

TLDR: My point is, I feel like I'm in a limbo between depression and good mental health, and that's what worries me. I don't want to fall into its clutches again.",depression

Parents are in that state where they’re about to call quits. My uncle who sexually abused me growing up is getting out of prison in a week. Everything is falling apart. There’s time where I feel nothing. Other times I can’t contain my tears. I’ve been in and out of counseling for years now. I feel like nobody cares.

830,t3_dik1la,Is it real depression what I have?,"Honestly I’m really F* sure I’m going though some kind of mental illness. The last few years I’ve been feeling more and more lonely and socially awkward. I was never and will never be a people person but I do like/would want to have a few close friends. I believe I do, I’m almost sure about it... not completely that I have them. Anyways, lately I got an intership in my field (which I like not gonna lie) and a side job with a friend. Additionally, I got the opportunity, mostly economic reasons (family), to go and study in Ukraine starting next year. (Last year I was already studying abroad in the states but had to come back for economic reasons) So I haven’t had time to spend with my friends here at home as much as I would like. 

I believe that I have so type of bad luck because whenever I do something with anybody, and I mean anybody, it’s usually the lamest or boring thing. EVERY SINCE TIME, it doesn’t matter where, when, for what reason or whatever. For example, the reason I met my now “close” friends are because I met one of them at the gym years back (I used to workout a lot, not anymore I live a sedentary live). Now, we are close but before I got my internship I wasn’t doing shit. But literally the week I started working, all of them decided to start working out together (my other friends didn’t used to workout at all) and have been training ever since and even went on competitions together, while I’ve been working or at home.  

But anyways, given all that I’ve been felling really shitty and lonely every since day. I usually smoke weed to forget about that tbh so I’ve become a regular consumer and I usually smoke with my friends. But since I haven’t seen them and  I’m so shitty at texting it to the point that almost no one text me, and since I don’t have that much time anymore,  I’ve been feeling miserable. I started crying more often months ago, but lately it has been happening every night.

I say “close” friends because idk how well they know me or if the amount of time that we talk, which is almost none, is enough to make me a close friends of them and since I’m not sure about that I don’t share to much personal issues about me. I’ve had breakdowns with some of them but still that self-doubt wins over me every since time. 

I really don’t care about it, not as it used to anyways, but I’m only laying a little bit of backstory to the whole thing since I mostly wanna know if I have something or not. That’s it. I’m tired of this and I don’t believe that the amount of shittiness I feel I go through is the same amount as a normal person. 

Ps: my mom once told me when she caught me some weed that I probably have bipolar disorder, but since I live in a third world country and mental health is basically a joke here I have never been to a psychologist, even though I’ve told my mom I would like to go.",depression
831,t3_difljs,my life and heightism,"I was feeling very sad lately and come across a post about a guy in /r/short wanting to have a taller son. My heart felt really heavy with the shit I've held so far. I decided to write this note, to share my struggle with everybody, I'm sure It will ease my pain. If you're the kind of guy of kind who's offended by grammar errors, I apologize in advance.I'm grateful for the opportunity to post such a thing.Exactly, a bit younger, I felt distinct. I had great manners, good grades and skilled player. Felt like the good can exist and is winning. It really hurts me now when I am overlooked for someone taller at a particular task even though I know that my skill level is above theirs. People tend to see them as having more potential &amp; all that non-provable shit. I think this is a thing short guys meet after a particular age. I really feel that the time I've put to enhance my skillet is a waste, at least If can I pass all I have to a son who won't face such problems, that might make me feel better and just. That why I want a taller son.

This is a bit personal now, I have secured a good future. I can do little effort and have what humble people call a good life. But I keep pushing my limits for something better. After all the shit I had, I really hesitate sometimes. I feel all that being powerful &amp; reaching your potential stuff Nietzsche talked about won't change the fact that I'll be seen as a skilled bastard or just a hack, not as a \*full\* man with a dream &amp; vision. Haaa I might as well die since what I was after is deprecated.

Two years ago, she told me I was perfect but unfortunately I'm short. I could instantly brush it off, I could be more powerful than this statement, but it doesn't change the fact that it's true. She wasn't trying to tease me for the slightest. Maybe that's how everybody considers me. All those times I wasn't invited despite all the times I gave. People return to me for advice, but never for fun. I feel so lonely all the time, always convinced myself that my efforts would eventually meet love and acceptance for who I am, yet even my family see my as a source of pride for the achievements I made but never for myself. I'm never boasted of at family reunions, I'm the ass they crack their jokes on. Oh and I can't be right and I just to swallow and pass. I feel like a kid among them.Shit, I'm 20 years old, I should be getting the most out of my life, yet I feel silly, a joke, an if-he-can-do-it-I-probably-can guy. My work is silly, my analysis is silly just an about-but-never-there thing. It feels like stage 0.

I'm fed up, I don't want to wake up anymore. The dreams I have are more than satisfying, times of the past when I was actually loved for who I am. When washing the car with my dad was something I've looked forward to with great passion. When my brother is teaching me the names of the star constellations.I wake up with the urge to find something better, to progress, time is running out. An urge without passion or emotional, like a biological order. But for whom ? why ? This life of mine is total pain.

I just wish it was more indulgent, I'm not unbreakable as I thought. Sheesh, I might die as well.",depression
832,t3_dihbrb,Sorry. This is going to be a long post. Just need to get some things off my chest tonight. Thank you to whoever reads this and I’m sorry.,"We all grow up thinking this and that. Thinking our life’s are going to turn out the way we always pictured it. That things are just going to fall into place at the right time. And they just work. We go to work, spend time with our children. Go to church(if that’s your thing). Play video games. Carry on our daily lives and just think everything is ok. Everything is right where it needs to be. And we don’t have a care in the world. 

But what if it does work that way? What if things don’t fall into place or we don’t get that promotion? We don’t get the girl? Our car breaks down, or the fridge doesn’t run right. What happens then? We figure it out. We move forward. We make plans, and have ideas on how to keep pushing forward until whatever was in our way, isn’t anymore. We work with people, we talk to therapist, take medication, go for walks, do whatever makes us happy. We push through. And then sometimes we don’t. 

Sometimes life throws us a curveball that just doesn’t fit. No matter what hole you put it in. It just doesn’t fit. And goddamnit we try. We try shaving some of the sides off, we try putting something on it to make it squeeze through. Hell sometimes we buy a bigger hole. Or small object. Or something, just to get things through. But what happens when it doesn’t fit? You tried everything. You tried literally everything within your power to fix whatever is broken. And it doesn’t work. 

In the last month I have felt everything. Anger. Sadness. Depression. Lost. Love. Betrayal. Hate. Worthlessness. Emptiness. Confusion. Sickness. Everything someone could possibly think of. I lost my wife. My apartment. My cat. My car. My father. My job. And everything I considered “mine”. Mine. Mine. Mine. I worked at a good job. Had good friends. Made good money. Gone. She was my best friend. We stayed up. Watched movies, watch monto, noob, horror movies, played video games together. Gone. My cat loved me. Cuddled when I would go long hours in a gaming session. Talked back if I didn’t feed him the food he wanted. He was MY buddy. I was close to my father. By any means. But what if we was? Now I’ll never actually have a relationship with him. I can never let him know it’s ok that he left. I forgive him. He was my father after all. So. Now I’ll never get the chance. My best friend told someone one of my secrets to someone. You tell your best friend everything and they just eat you out. You don’t know who to trust anymore. Or how to feel. Iv lost so much in the past month I have nothing left to lose. 

And that’s just it. I don’t have anything else. I just don’t. Everything was TAKEN from me and I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have a say in the matters. I didn’t have a voice to say how it made me feel. I was alone for a month. No one came and saw me. No one asked me how I was doing. Nothing. I was alone. Utterly alone. And I begged. I pleaded. I was on my hands and knees begging for something. It’s tore me apart. I’m not a human being anymore. I’m a problem. I’m not who I use to be. I will never be who I use to be. I can’t laugh. If I do it’s fake. It’s hiding that I just want to be alone because it’s what I’m use to now. I want to fight people just to make them go away from me. I don’t want help. I don’t want anything. And the bad part? No one can actually stop me. If someone has their mind made up they will find a way to follow through with whatever they want. I loved a good life. I had everything I wanted before the age of 30. And now. I’m happy. Everything I dreamed of when I was a child I did it. I made it happen. I lived my life. 

I’m sorry. I’m sorry to everyone I had to hurt during this time. But I don’t regret anything I have ever done. I don’t for one second. I learned and I grew. I laughed and I cried. I felt alone and I was surrounded by people I love. I had everything. And I’m happy. I was alone for so long. No one text me throughout the day. No one ask me how I’m doing. No one. And ya know what? I’m ok with it now. It’s weird when someone does it. And that’s ok. 

I just wanted to get this stuff off my chest. In no way is any of this ment to mean anything. I just want this out of the way. I’m not ok. I’m just not. I live in a world of illusions. I’m not ok. Thank you. For whoever read this.",depression

For years now I've struggled between balancing my actual self, who is very ""lazy"", doesn't want to study or work at all and procrastinates a lot, and the self I am in my mind (or at least who I want to be), who does productive things that make me happy, studies, improves. I've finished undergrad in a major I'm passionate about in my mind, but not in actions. I ended up with mediocre grades, and pretty much no knowledge retained. I probably couldn't pass a single exam now. However, despite this, I want to go to grad school in a few years, which means I need to start intensely studying for admission exams, like, right now. I also need to find work to gain experience, and generally develop a work ethic that will allow me to succeed because I can't go on like I did in undergrad. But I can't bring myself to do anything. Can't crack a book open, can't watch an educational video. Even non-learning stuff like reading leisure books or watching new TV shows or going out of the apartment, I simply can't do. I know I am very privileged to not have to work to support myself currently, but not being absolutely forced to work means that all I am able to do is stay home, re-watch the old shows I've watched a thousand times and do a particular hobby craft I'm fixated on. I sit on the couch and do this all. Day. Long. Can't even go on a walk, which I used to love. All day long I keep thinking ""I should do this and that"",  ""I'm wasting away my life"", ""I really should do that thing now"" but then I end up just not doing anything. I hate myself for it. This is not the person I want to be. I have so many great aspirations in my head, but you would have never known judging by my life

I know for sure I have some kind of depression. It comes and goes, sometimes it's only a background noise, sometimes it cripples me. These days the hole I've been stuck in has been quite deep and very suicidal-y at times, but I had problems with lack of motivation forever now, even in times when my depression lets up. So is it laziness, or depression, or a mix of both? If I see a therapist for depression, or take meds, is there a chance of my laziness improving from that? Or is this something I have to fix separately? Has anyone been able to overcome this?",depression
839,t3_difcju,I feel like an alien,"I’m 30f, and for as long as I can remember, I have sort of… kept myself separate from other people. As a kid, I would climb trees and sit up high for hours, just thinking. Art has always been an outlet for me, and while I lamented the fact that I felt emotionally isolated from other people, I also drew a lot of inspiration from it. I have a very rich “inner world” that I tap into and feel connected with, even now. My mind is always full of ideas, many of which are half-baked or ill-defined. But I have this compulsion to retreat from people, to be alone and shut off, to watch others live their lives from a separate, disconnected world. 

From the outside, I have a pretty idyllic life. I have a lot of close friends, a good job, and an active social life. I volunteer. I’ve been madly in love. I still model sometimes, and I travel when I can. I have nothing to complain about…

Except for this pervasive feeling that I’m sort of… alien. Like I’d rather be a part of the wall or the floorboards so I could be near others without being involved. I don’t know how to explain it beyond that. I’ve taken medication for anxiety/depression on and off, but I don’t feel like myself when I’m on it, and I feel like an alien when I’m not. I don’t mind feeling this way I suppose, like an alien. It can be very lonely because I feel like no one really knows me. And I don’t want them to know me because that would require explaining this sensation that my real life is in my own mind, that my own life feels like a conversation I’m overhearing. It’s like I spent my entire life in this melancholic, contemplative state, and now being content feels wrong and restrictive. I can’t be creative in a meaningful way when I’m medicated, and I derive so much of my self-worth from being able to create, to tap into an emotional space that is somewhat uncomfortable. 

I don’t really know why I’m writing this. I just felt kind of sad today, but also so much like myself. And I wish those two things weren’t so intertwined sometimes.",depression
840,t3_dih3w4,Joining the Navy was a mistake.,"I'll try to keep this short but substantial. I am 6 months into the Navy and out into fleet and day by day, I am regretting the decision I made. The number one thing that bothers me is that I am constantly depressed while at work and having to put on a fake happy, motivated persona to not set off any red flags to my chain of command. My Navy experience so far has been doing manual labor, but where it really bothers me is my chain of command laughing as if it was a joke(Saying ""ok you're my slave for the day"" for ex). Some of the people in my own division who are of the same rank don't do the work I am selected to do.(Favoritism?)

My division tried to get me to talk to them, but most of them enjoy talking down to others and being unprofessional for not being like them. No thank you, I will not be hanging out with you people after working hours.

But where it really hits home for me is the lack of interaction with the public(civilians). I am starting to miss my old job at McDonald's because at least then, I was able to interact with customers. I would like to be able to talk to people as part as my work than just move boxes around.

 It has gotten bad for me to the point where I had to make up imaginary friends that were there for support to get me through the day because I am sure as f#$@ not getting that from my division.

The Navy itself is easy, but the environment and the culture will prove a challenge for some.

I have literally zero irl friends and lurk mainly within internet forums. My latest report card for junior year came in and my parents flipped out over Bs and Cs, because those are failing grades. I finally realized I'm never going to have a future, and I might as well kill myself before my 18th birthday. My parents have been screaming at me all day and are threatening to take away all of my art supplies, even though art is the only thing that brings me joy. I cannot survive on this planet any longer, and every day of my life so far has been nothing but guilt and hurt. I wish I was never born, even though I was an accident anyway.

When I woke up, I texted my friend about it because the weight of the situation hadn't hit me yet (it still hasnt). Later that night said friend and their mom came over to my house secretly to give me icecream and console me. The next day my both of them came over to my house again. Their mom talked to my mom about everything because I hate talking to my mom about stuff like this (she didnt rat me out, just tried to pressure her into getting me to a counselor) while me and my friend just chilled out. Later that night, my mom came and talked to me about her chat. She asked me about it, and when I didnt say anything due to me being scared shitless and feeling guilty for everything, she started to guilt trip me into giving her answers! She started saying terrible things about how I must think shes a terrible mother if I need to confide my mental health issues in a friend's mom and not her, and bullshit like that. She asked how she could help me with everything and I told her to do some research about mental health and she excused my request by saying that ""our family is rot with it"".

846,t3_diaft1,This is my first time posting on anything,"For anyone who reads this thank you. I have been fighting depression since i was a child. I am fortunately married now with 4 kids who are not biologically mine but mine all the same. I do have another daughter from a previous engagement bit due to issues the mother has with me she withholds my daughter from me. I have not seen her since she was an infant(in person). And it has been over 6 years now and i have watcher her grow up through poctures my ex's sister sends me. Now my 4 i will come out and say im not the worlds greatest dad im distant, i fly off the handle, and to be honeat from years of abuse from my parents and feeling abandoned by almost everyone i had in my old life before i got married its very hard for my to understand most feelings. Like love i know i would die for my kids, i will make they have everything they need before i even remotely consider myself. When times were bad for my wife and i money wise their were quite a few time qhere i made sure they and had the things they needed for school and the would leave around dinner using the excuse pf work or i need to pick up somthing so they would know that we didnt have enough for me to eat but times are better now money wise. Now i want to clarify the flying of the handle. I was abused by my parents as a kid my dad beat me constantly and my mother i apologize for the language but fucked with my head so bad she pretty much gas lighted me into thinking so little of my self i still cant get over that. On that note i snap at little things like my kids talking back to my wife or being spiteful like children are and get angryer than i should. But i will never ever raise a hand to them. And im sorry if im jumping topics because i. Currently hiding from my wife and eldst son so they do see me crying. But i hate that i am so distant from mu children. And i know its from the depression, the fear of becoming my father, and the guilt of not being a father to my daughter. Which you would think wpuld be easy to fix the last one. And on paper it is all i have to do is invole the state and do it throight the courts, but i cant face her. I cant handle the possibility of her rejecting my too and asking me why i abandoned her. I will not poison her against her mother because i know her mother loves her very much and i believe one day she will make her own decisions about her but she is only 6 now.  What brought this up is mu middle son got hurt in school 2 weeks agoand has been out till today where i brought him back and spoke to the principal and the nurse and my kids go to the school i graduated from And also i work as a custodian for 6 years. Also durring my time there i had gotten my mother a job there and when my ex and i split my mother spewed all these lies about me to anyone and everyone she could talk to. Although I didn't see her today and in all honesty see my mother doesn't bother me that much anymore I found out she had gotten my ex a job ther and we ran into each other. At first I was so overwhelmingly angry it was very hard to keep my cool. But now I'm just having a hard time keeping it together. I was hoping since I've never done this before and usually keep to myself that maybe this would make me feel better.

But then, when things start to work fine, routine and exercise and trying to improve(be it for a day or maybe a week), the nights get really hard to go through. Anxiety, can't sleep, no one to talk to, I begin to crave for the company of the bottle of whatever cheap stuff I stocked for emergencies like this.

I’ve tried just about every medicine I can, but this depression/anxiety is beginning to consume my soul.

I feel like a walking, empty black hole. I have no emotions except for anxious, sad, and mad. 

I hate everything about myself and I’m not sure if I’ll ever be normal. I hate myself beyond measure and when I look in the mirror I get sick. Even hearing my name makes me nauseous.

853,t3_digsyr,"I know the reasons I'm depressed, yet still I do nothing","I've been taking so good hard looks at my depression, why it's there, why it's not going away, all that. I have come to the (hopefully accurate) conclusion, that most of my problems are literally just me. For instance, every night for like 5 years now, I do the same routine. Get in bed, lie there, think about my life, the universe, etc. I go down the rabbit hole and end up just asking myself why am i always alone, no matter how likeable I am, no matter how much I try to make other happy. I spend an immaculate amount of time, energy, and sometimes even money, trying to get others to laugh, to smile. I do it with strangers, acquaintances, family, everyone. Humor is my go to, for every situation I come across. Anyway, even though I'm 100% aware that my biggest problem, and my most solvable problem, loneliness that is, I always end up at the end of the day, no new texts, calls, DM's, invites, nothing. Just me. Alone in my room, staring at my phone, or my TV. I know that I could ask people if they want to do something, yet I've never done that. I've never, in my LIFE, been the one to begin the social outing. 

I'm terrified of being alone and not having anyone or anything to talk to, yet if no one talks to me, I do nothing about it. It's like I'm shy to the point its crippling, and in order to solve a big problem I have, I must go and talk to people. Shy is a weird word though, because I have no problem being the center of attention, making people happy, whatever. But I never start the convo. Anytime I think about starting the conversation, my anxiety kicks into maximum fucking overdrive, and then I'm basically useless until I calm down. I have no idea why, and I have no idea how to fix it. 

If you've stuck around this long, you must care, even in the slightest. So, I'm 17, never had an actual girlfriend, and have been depressed since like 2013. I always kept up great grades and was pretty smart. When I was with my family, no matter that age, I always made sure that people were happy. If the conversation got dull, I'd tell a joke. I'm a smartass too, so it usually goes pretty well. Anyway, I've always been good at math, science, english, whatever. If it was school, I did not need to worry. But then, I start struggling. Pre calc starts kicking my ass, science is just gibberish now, and my most hated subject, english, is my best grade. I'm terribly sad all the time, I dont want to do anything except sleep, I dont go out with friends more then once a month, I'm only like 14 or 15 at this time, so I dont have a job quite yet, so I literally sit at home and do nothing. I end up skipping my first month of classes junior year. I literally spent the first 30 days of my junior year in the cafeteria doing nothing. I dont even know why. It's not like the classes were boring, I was taking drivers ed, a math, a science, a english, and a communications elective. All easy as hell, yet there I am: in the cafeteria, on my phone. I was able to do this through some attendance error, but that's not the point. 

I've got some issues which I'd rather not talk about, no matter how anonymous the platform, but regardless, here I am. 17, almost 18, lying in bed, writing this for validation from strangers because I dont have any friends around since I graduated last year. Leave what advice you want, try to relate, do whatever. I'm just glad that I got this chance to explain myself, and get a good rant out without damaging any personal relationships.

I see no point in fighting for a life I fucked up royally in every which way and, frankly, am continuing to do so. Yes I am a passive suicidal person. Only because I am too much of a cowardly sackless pile of pig shit to even take my own life properly, and believe me I have tried. I have nothing to offer any woman or the world for that matter. I have no love and no hope. I just exist. I write here in  hopes to shut my inner demons party upstairs down. Not like anyone cares let alone read these anyways. I am just 1 person on a planet of 7 billion people. What do I matter? Me dying would be like taking away a single sand grain from the Sahara. Barely anyone would notice let alone mourn. I am just an invisible person fighting....and losing an invisible war. So here I raise a glass to an early death. After all, the world could do better than me any day.",depression
857,t3_dijibv,I'm too afraid to share my depression with anyone,"Years ago, before I truly have depression, I used to talk with a friend of mine whenever I felt bad. But I had so much negative energy that my friend couldn't handle it, and that friend decided to leave me. From that moment, I'm so afraid to share about my true negative thought about anything. Since I knew that I had depression, I've tried to share more with my family and my friend. But deep down in my mind, I still afraid that they will leave me someday like my old friend used to. Beside, because I know that everyone always has a thing in there life and that's hard enough, how can I make the people I love more tired. I do tell them about my depression, but that's all they know. I never tell them about what I feel, how and when the depression comes to me. It's like, when I feel depress or cry, I don't tell them. I just tell them when It's over and my emotion ""back to normal"", but usually I don't. I had tried to talk to them when I felt depress some times, but they were confused and didn't know what to say or do and they tried to avoid it a little bit. Example like recently an idol died, I'm not a fan of her, but when I read the articles about her death, I cried so much that my eyes swelled. When I told them about how much I cried when I heard about this news, they told me that I just felt discontent because of her death or just talking about the topics surrounding her death. But that's not the point. So I stop sharing my emotion, but I don't know what to do.

And now I couldn't bear it anymore, I want someone that I can talk to. But how can I know if they will leave me or not.",depression

863,t3_dicboy,Caution. Don't stop taking your meds.,"I have at times seen many posts of people who have gotten frustrated with their medications that they decide to go off them. People need to always go through a doctor when going off meds. If someone decides to go off them that's a personal choice and I hope the best for that person. I highly caution how we might encourage others who are mentally ill who NEED their medication that going off their meds is a good idea. Some people need their meds. They are saving their lives the same way heart medicine saves a heart patient. It's definately saving mine. I work in a psych unit.  The number one common denominator is that patients have gone off their meds without a doctor's supervision. As fellow survivors of mental health illnesses we need to encourage each other to keep doing recovery, what helps us. So many of us are highly influenced by others. Doctors therapists, care workers and other professionals should do the counseling when it comes to meds. Now I believe asking what experiences people have had on this med or that med is very productive.  Venting about your medication and frustration can be also productive. I propose thinking about the most vulnerable on here. Speaking to all as if they are the most vulnerable. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day.",depression

865,t3_dieshe,The loneliest I've felt in my life,"So firstly, a bit about me. I'm in a middle class family with above average living standards, I'm 17, socially incompetent, I'm in my second year of college, so starved of positive attention that I fall in love with any girl who complements me in any way, and I feel miserable almost all the time, especially recently. I've got only two friends, one who tolerates almost everything and anyone and another who constantly talks behind other people's backs. Most of the time it's justified, but one of the problems is that I don't know if she talks about me as well. I just feel like an irritating nuisance. I then tried using subreddits like r/needafriend, but that only was short term. I was at first talking to someone in America, but after a while she stopped talking with me. Then I found someone else from Germany called Vanessa, but she's changed how she talks with me. At first I was struggling to keep up with her messages almost everyday, but now she just seems like she wants me to leave her alone. I ask her how her day has been and all I get is ""yeah it's been fine"". I don't want to be irritating, but I never can tell when someone wants to talk or if they're struggling to talk. For example, my friend Yasmin messaged me while she was on holiday for some strange reason, but talking with her was painfully difficult. I told her of all the things that I can talk about and all she messaged was ""wow that's alot"" I feel like I'm just a last resort. If they have a friend, they're fine, but if they don't and they're desperate enough they talk to me.

870,t3_dijce0,My Whole Family is Suffering,"I'm 16. My brother is 18. My mother is 45. My father is 48.

Every single one of us has depression.

Perhaps it was just genetic unluckiness, the state of the world (which seems to be getting worse every day), or a combination of many different factors (probably that, but I digress).

We're all very open to each other about our troubles. This brings us closer together when one of us is suffering, but it seems to have devolved into a vicious cycle of us all making each other feel worse and worse.

For two years, my brother has been struggling with motivation to go to a school of any kind. He's put on 40 pounds (\~18 kilos) or so over that time after discovering food as a coping mechanism. He is high-functioning on the autism spectrum and he didn't even realize he was as depressed as he is. He thought that not talking to his friends, not going outside, and asking for fast food from my dad every time he left the house was normal. I had to tell him to talk to his therapist about it and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

My mother's hardships are similar to mine. She has the same diagnosis of panic disorder, but her depression is treatment-resistant. Right now, she goes to her psychiatrist (which my father and I share with her because American healthcare is awful and expensive) every couple of days for a treatment that leaves her exhausted for the whole day. For two months, she's done this regularly, and it's not been working well for her. She feels like she is useless, and none of us feel like we can do much to help her.

I share a lot of things with my father, too. I look like him and act a lot like him, and that's made us very close. Unfortunately, I also share with him his stoic personality and sometimes-destructive reactions to stress. Because my mom has been struggling so much for the past two months, he's had to act as both parents at once. He's drinking more often in the evenings, and while he's making a very good effort to slow down, I think he's still searching for other ways to shove his emotions down even further. My brother and I have had to teach ourselves to be more independent, too, which has put more weight on our shoulders as well.

I'm having a lot of trouble myself. I'm switching to a new anti-depressant, and my/my mom's/my dad's psychiatrist neglected to tell me that the one I'm no longer taking is one of the most difficult medications of its kind to come off of. I hit rock bottom today after a week of not taking it at all. In the past two weeks, I never thought I would rely as much as I have on caffeine in my entire life. It worries me more to see my father struggling with alcohol, as I fear I might be next.

I want to help my family as much as I want to help myself, but I don't know where to turn anymore. Every time I see my therapist, I get stuck in the trap of trying to impress them and my mind seems to immediately forget all of these problems I have until I am forced to face them again. If it's just an issue of credibility or not clicking completely, I worry I won't be able to find someone else that's qualified and my parents can pay for.

We can't afford a family therapist. We can barely afford individual therapy for each of us, let alone a separate psychiatrist that I don't have to share with my parents. We're even considering emigrating to another country (for a multitude of reasons, but healthcare being a large part of it). Turning to an online forum was a last resort for me, but I don't think my family can ever know that I did until things get better.

This may be too much for the people here to handle helping with, and it may just be a matter of time until things get better. Anything you can recommend for me to cope with the stress or any suggestions you might have that could help my family would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",depression

I always took that as allegory, as in ""dieting isn't fun."" I never made the connection before, never really groked this concept.

But now I notice that when I am actively cycling down my weight, the depression and anxiety actually are greater.

I'll have a week I feel pretty OK, not great, but holding it together.  Then I'll get on the scale and see I'm up 2 kilos.  Damn!

I make a commitment, the next week, I eat low carbs, reduce the snacks.  Lose weight.  More exercise.  By end of the week, I'm down two kilos again. But it's a shit week!  More anxiety, more suicidal ideation, less hope, more fear, more anger.

I haven't been allowed to do anything for two months, so I have an excuse to not go out. I've never been this bad. I used to be into s/h but this is so much different. I feel lonely, I feel lost. I feel stupid and judged. I feel like I belong nowhere. 

The only reason I'm alive is because I think about my mom crying and her having told me she's so worried about me. She told me she's always scared I'm gonna hurt myself or off myself. I just am waiting for her to get out of jail, I miss my mom. I miss her so much. She's the only person I truly feel loves me, she accepts me and she cares. She asks about everything and she's accepting of everything, every little thing I say, she still loves me, and even when I piss her off, I still feel that she loves me. She's the only thing keeping me going.

874,t3_did5q0,Today doesn’t feel good,"I'm really feeling like I'm at the end of what I can handle. Every day I feel worse and worse. I know it's typical for depression, but I feel like a waste of space that has no future. The short and sweet version, I've been in and out of college, switching majors, getting the classes and grades I needed for nursing, only to be rejected by multiple schools. I started a pre-nursing track at a school an hour away in hopes of another route. I did one semester, but the school was too expensive and I realized that I don't even have a passion for nursing to make the payments work. This only brought on the realization that I was looking at nursing school for the wrong reasons and I'm actually completely lost in where I want to take my career. Since then, I've looked into different options and worked towards some option school wise, but things have either not worked out or not been the right fit. Despite depression and anxiety being things I battle with normally, this has all led me into one of the most depressed and anxiety filled year of my life. On and off wanting to kill myself, but never feeling quite to a point of making a plan to follow through. Each day is getting harder though. I'm having more bad days than good and feeling more lost than ever. Life feels more and more meaningless and I'm honestly just tired. I've been in search for a counselor, but i'm hitting dead ends there too. My search of counselors is that they are not taking new patients, or not taking insurance (I can't afford weekly appts of \~$125 each).

So, I'm lost. I feel like a wreck of emotions. I cry all the time and smaller things are setting me off. Last night I was kicked from an overwatch group and unfriended by the guy (not for being toxic or anything btw, but apparently wasn't good enough), and this morning I was called into work at a different office that I’ll be closing at. If I step back and think about it, these things are small, may suck, but aren’t a big deal. But I cried my whole way to work and have been fighting off tears at work the whole morning. Faking happiness for customers/coworkers is exhausting today. 

I have an appointment with my primary doctor next week and I’m really holding onto hope that she’ll have some options for me. Ideally I would like her to refer me to a counselor that will accept me as a patient, but I’m open to medication changes.

I’m on a downward spiral of self loathing. 

Most of the time when I have really long and drawn out bouts of depression, it starts because of a significant mistake on my part or some failure, and an inability to recover from that. For instance, when I was broken up with a couple years back, and I felt like it was something I could’ve saved had I made better choices, I became really self destructive and my grades plummeted, I lost a lot of friends, and I had random emotional meltdowns everyday for nearly a year. Also, I didn’t get into the college I wanted to go to because of it. 

I spent the last year going to a local college, getting my self esteem back, and I thrived. I had a 3.8 GPA, I did really well, and I even made it into the college I initially wanted to go to. Well, I’m here now, and I regret ever coming. I changed my major and had to drop a class, meaning I’m only taking three classes now, and I have a C in two of them. My boyfriend and my parents have both expressed their immense disappointment in me because they “know I can do better,” and they think it’s because I’ve been partying. I haven’t been to a single party. I’ve done some social things, but definitely not enough to warrant my grades slipping this much. I wanted this so badly and I feel like I’m just fucking it all up and letting everyone down. And when I feel like a failure, it only gets worse, and I get deeper and deeper into the slump. Does anyone have any help? I’m feeling kind of hopeless at the moment.",depression

885,t3_dij31u,I don't know what to do.,"(M 16)

I feel that I have severe anxiety and depression but have spent the last four years hiding it. That has just been my way of dealing with it. (I know that it is probably the worst thing to do) I have never been to a doctor about it.

I do not eat as much as I should. Usually 1 meal a day, some days going without food at all. I get very little sleep which may be because I am so extremely stressed out over everything all day and night. I realize I have a problem but don't know what to do.

I work at a summer camp and I realized one day that although I enjoy what I do, I was telling myself, before I walked to my class, over and over that I need to smile, to act happy, and started wondering, why am I am so sad when I am doing something I like?  I stopped walking and just froze as I came to this realization. I am beginning to realize that my entire day is an act, to pretend I am happy and to not let the people around me catch on that there is a problem with me.

My family does not know about it because I try as hard as I can to act ""normal""  I don't want to bring my situation up to my parents because they are already going through a lot with my grandmother. I do not feel that they will take me seriously or fully understand how bad my situation is because I always act happy around them.

I am tired of acting and am not sure how long I can keep up the act.

My parents may have an idea about it but do not understand nearly how bad it is or that it is still happening. I have had counceling on and off my whole life but never continued after two or three months. The reason I don't want to do counceling is that I do not like talking about depression or anxiety, especially with someone I barely know. Also, there is really nothing they can tell me that I don't already know. Why would I pay to talk to someone I am not comfortable talking to, about something I am not not comfortable talking about, and all I get out of it is information I already know? Also it has never worked for me.

I have no interest in school or homework. The only thing that keeps me going is drama. There was a point last year when I was not doing great in math (not my best subject) but was trying my best. I was not failing but my parents threatened to pull me from drama. If this happened, I think I would have completely lost hope and any drive to do anything. I would have pretty much given up.

I have one friend who I would consider my best friend. I can talk to this person and am comfortable around them, although I try as hard as I can to avoid mental health topics because I don't want to expose them to my issues. They seem to be catching on.

I have completed lost interest in hobbies and other activities I used to enjoy and am starting to not be able to keep up with school. I feel like I am drowning in life.

At night and when I am alone I am flooded with anxiety and depressing thoughts. My way of dealing with this is to never have time when I am not doing something. Without realizing it I will over book myself and overwork my self untill I can't do it anymore and burn myself out.

I feel like a horrible, selfish person to feel this way because I know there are people that have it worse then me. I will lie in bed at night thinking I will talk to someone the next day but wake up in the morning and convince myself that everything is fine and continue the act.

I feel like I am wasting my life, not getting everything out of it that I could be.

As I am writing this I am doing relatively okay, but because I am doing ""okay"" now, means I am going to crash and be doing 100 times worse very soon.

I don't know what to do, who to talk to, or if I should just deal with it the way I have been. Should I talk to my parents? My friend? Or something anonymous? I am completely lost.

Also, at this time I am not a threat to myself.",depression

893,t3_di7fdr,I'm scared about making a GP appointment,"I finally signed up to my local gp after 2 years of living in a different city by myself, which I'm proud of, but that was when I was feeling good.

I thought my mental health had just miraculously improved and I would be fine.

I stay in bed all day, get caught up in my own thoughts of shame and cry, any other person would be grossed out by my room and I know it makes me calm for it to be clean, but I just don't see the point.

896,t3_diiwjf,What is depression?,"Is it an emotion? Is it a state of life? Is it an inevitable conclusion? I've gone through it all, and I feel like it being an inevitable conclusion makes the most sense. 

Yes, it is common for people to go through devastating sadness, through loss or hurt. You go through it often enough, consistently, and it can seem a normal state of life. 

What I've found and experienced is that the inevitable conclusion is depression. It's just human nature. If you're really aware of how the world works, and understand the fundamental questions of human nature, depression is the default, logical conclusion. No matter how bad things get, you can always expect them to get worse, instead of improving. No matter how good things get, you can always see a better situation and want for that, or worry that something unexpected will make your good situation worse.  

I'm not saying all of this to discourage, but to hopefully provide a different way of looking at things. Instead of defaulting to the inevitable, look for ways to improve your situation. If you're in a good place, look for ways to make it even better, instead of worrying about the worst.

Tldr: the preceding was the drunken ramblings of a depressed individual who can clearly see the bad situation he's in. I choose to looks for ways to improve my lot, no matter how drastic. And you should too.",depression
897,t3_diarcq,Content but sad,"I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post. Maybe just writing my feelings down and blasting it into the internet so that someone, anyone, will read and understand? Maybe advice from somebody who has been through a similar experience? All of that said, I'll write a list of facts below, followed up with some thoughts and feelings.

Re-diagnosed ADHD  a bit over \~2ish years ago, played with medication until we found one that works 6 months ago (Vyvanse, 40mg currently)

Serious suicide attempt in 2016 (obviously failed), went to inpatient care, diagnosed depression (Taking WellbutrinXL, 300mg)

Since returning from my inpatient treatment (which was horrible), I have continued seeing a psychiatrist regularly. After finding a med balance that seemed to work (this took a long time), I was on fire - my work productivity was finally at a place I could be proud of, I got married, my wife and I bought two houses and moved twice, we got another dog that is awesome - it has been one sharp, upward peak. When I proposed, at our wedding and during our honeymoon trip, when we adopted our new dog and when I planned a surprise birthday party for my wife, I was absolutely jubilant. The last year has been on a steady, sharp incline, and I had gotten back to feeling things, being excited and looking forward to doing things and all of that.

After we finished moving into our new(est) house and settled, I got back to exercising regularly and eating healthy. I started going to therapy about a month or two before we moved because I was starting to get angry about things at work (I have a usually fast-paced job that requires creativity on things that we do pretty much annually, which is challenging in itself, and I frequently work with people who lack a lot of mental capacity.) I was bringing that anger home with me, and it was affecting my relationship at home. I have found therapy to be helpful in being able to vent, and we are starting to get into some other stuff that may be affecting how I feel about certain things.

However, in the past few weeks, I have started to feel more down. Although I wasn't expecting a surprise party or a present, I felt let down that my wife didn't seem to put much thought or effort into my birthday. It sounds stupid writing it down, but it hurt. We went out to dinner and sat at a bar hoping for some friends to meet up, and after a little while, my wife, almost petulantly, said she was done and ready to go home. I said I wasn't quite ready yet, but I wouldn't be upset if she left. She seemed to be upset at that answer, so we left, and on the ride home, she said that she didn't get me anything for my birthday because she didn't know what I would want. I'm not upset that she didn't get anything, as I'm happy to spend a nice evening with her, but I was hurt that she said that in that manner. I feel like that just didn't need to be said, and it made me feel like an afterthought. Our anniversary was the same way - she happened to be off of work, so I took the day off to spend with her. We discussed doing a few nice things - going to a nearby wildlife refuge with a picnic lunch, possibly going to dinner, backup plan of going to lunch at the place that made our wedding cake in case of inclement weather. We ended up running errands for the majority of the day. I did take us to dinner that night, and it was nice, but we made no effort to do anything we talked about. Yes, we got to spend time together, but I feel like there wasn't anything done to commemorate our first year of marriage.

So over the last few weeks, I have felt down in general. I don't think that those caused it, as I was already feeling that way, but those were definitely my lowest ... until the last few days. I haven't been able to stop crying. My wife will tell me something that sounds judgemental or in a certain tone of voice that makes me a little weepy (which usually doesn't happen) and I will tell her that she is saying something hurtful or in a hurtful way. She has asked if I'm hiding anything (I'm not) because I seem so overly sensitive, and she feels like she needs to walk on eggshells because she doesn't know what will set me off. I tell her that I've just been feeling emotional and I am overly sensitive to people's tone of voice/criticisms, and she will sound angry or condescending and say that if there is nothing wrong, I need to stop crying ... which makes it worse. I had a full on, fall to the floor, arms around my knees meltdown this morning, and she just seemed mad about it. Which made me feel worse. It's a really vicious cycle. And it's compounded by the fact that I have been working on this stuff, and I'm not getting better, or I guess I should say that I made progress and I feel like it is all unravelling now.

I also feel like the only person I can talk to is my therapist. I don't feel like I have any friends I can talk to, and my wife isn't receptive to ""there's nothing wrong, I'm just sensitive.""

I know that everything I've said about my wife above is negative, but she really is incredible and I love her, and she loves me. We have way more positive experiences than negatives, and I know she is having a hard time with these mood swings that I'm having and it's incredibly frustrating to deal with, especially since there's nothing wrong - I know that she has to feel helpless because I don't know what to tell her.

898,t3_diiujv,"Feel lost. Enjoy this rambling story of mine, sorry for any grammar errors just couldn’t stop typing my thoughts.","Hello everyone, hope you’re all having a good night, I’m making this post because I been reading forums on here of so many things that relate to me &amp; it makes me feel better in a way that I’m not alone but my main point here is. I suffer with hardcore OCD &amp; ADHD when I was a kid but never knew because nobody ever seemed to somehow notice...I’m really not sure how or maybe they just passed it off (my parents) I had a blessed life when it came to living pretty good &amp; I know that but still I can’t help the fact that I hate myself &amp; honestly have since I was like 13. Odd thing is I’m very happy &amp; postive usually around people &amp; come off great (they say) but at the same time I’m scared shitless to meet new people cause I fear they will hate me even though I can’t recall many people hating me... it’s just like something that makes me feel held down. I have no close friends besides my amazing fiancé &amp; im blessed for that but I’m so confused with myself everyday. When I was a kid I was so odd. My dad would asked me if I brushed my teeth &amp; I wouldn’t be able to say yes cause I felt like I was lying cause he wasn’t there to see it? It makes nooooooo sense at all I know but I just couldn’t say yes. I use to have to count to ten before saying things sometimes when I was really young (that faded thankfully) but now my ocd has chilled a lot more but I still will make like sound effects quietly when doing things just cause stress or something. I never really been able to talk to my dad about my feelings ever. I was def a mommas boy but my dad had a bad dad so I get he’s trying his best to be great &amp; just has a hard time opening up but I just feel like we have no relationship &amp; it’s just so hard to start a talk because he will put up a wall. I know this post is ALL over the place but it’s nice to type this &amp; just say it idk. I’ve been prescribed to addy for about 3 years now &amp; it’s helped in ways but not fully, I just have zero motivation &amp; feel like a disappointment everyday to my dad (def a childhood issue) I just feel like a fuck up &amp; broke. I’m only 22 so I know there’s loads of time to fix whatever this is but I just feel stuck. I feel like everyone thinks I’m dumb but I feel like I’m smart in ways but to scared to talk out loud sometimes because I fear the shut down of you’re dumb or something. I’ve never felt like anyone else around me my whole life &amp; I drink to numb how I feel &amp; pump some indie jams (music is a huge part of my life) I’m not really looking for an answer here I guess but maybe people to talk too? I just know I’m a good person who always respects people around him but im just scared of life in a way. My counselor who I’ve been seeing for around 5 years said he’s never met anyone so hard on themselves. I’m thinking about looking into another medicine to maybe help my thoughts still stressed it’ll become some take everyday to numb what I feel thing. I’ve drank prob every night for the past 4 years because I hate myself the most at night. My thoughts haunt me. Tell me I’m a horrible fuck up &amp; for some reason I deserve this. I haven’t been the perfect human but I know I’m a nice person. I wish I could drop the drink &amp; be okay without but I get scared...so scared. Like since I was 12 I’ve never been able to sleep good at all cause my thoughts. I have insane dreams that’ll I’ll scream in my sleep &amp; my girl will have to wake me up. I just feel like I’m fucked. I use to have so much more of a positive personality but now I feel it’s gone.

I'm currently a senior in high school and on paper things are looking good. In my day to day life nothing noteworthy comes up but it's like I can feel myself slipping away from everything. I don't know if it's just my perception but I'm so sensitive to anything that happens to me. The pettiest things can set me off, ruining my day and its happening so frequently now that I think some of my friends are getting concerned. Just today I nearly broke down in tears because I spilled something in my backpack. I had one of my closest friends trying to encourage me for the rest of the day and while I appreciate the effort the positive emotions were fleeting. I get spitting mad at little things friends do and end up bottling everything up because I know I'm being irrational. If I say what I'm feeling at the moment I know that it'll only burn bridges but keeping everything in makes me feel disgusting. Its a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. 

I try and tell myself that tomorrow is a different day and most people are worried about keeping themselves happy. I can't look into minute details of an interaction because there's nothing underhanded about it but I still end up feeling like everyone I love only thinks of me in fleeting moments. I've been fluctuating between resenting and loving my best friend even though she's done nothing wrong, I still feel betrayed by little actions, things like not texting back or being tired. I hate it because sometimes it feels like I don't know what reality is and that what I'm feeling may or may not be correct.

More recently I've had sudden, crushing, feelings of just pure sadness and exhaustion. I'll be fixing my hair or waiting for class to start and I just feel the urge to cry and or sleep.

'Shut the fuck up you're so skinny wtf'...""

Now I'm tall and fluctuate between 102 and 105 lbs (please dont feel badly anyone im not trying to flex that's never my intention to make anyone feel bad im trying to put a little background in this). I eat constantly and work out a lot and stuff but for some reason I cannot gain weight for the life of me. So I'm super fucking bony and have had a lot of scrutiny for my diet and accused of eating disorders, my size was the main target of my ex's abuse...

So I weighed myself a couple weeks ago and discovered I had went from 102 to 107 and got upset cause that was the most I ever weighed. I wanted to lose that five pounds. Like, intellectually I knew the weight was good or whatever, but idk why I was so upset about it. So then I said something about it to some friends and they both looked at me as though I had grown an additional head and said exactly what that text post had said (the stfu one) and I was like bro that doesnt help cause I still feel that way...

i haven’t dealt with this. i’ve gained upwards of 25 pounds, i have relapse after relapse, i’ve isolated from everyone, and i’m a cold person because of it. i’m a shell. the worst part is, i can’t see any way out.

**Present Me** is is a child. Afraid of failure and ridicule. Constantly worried about an abstract future. He's tired all the time and struggles to keep up with life; Always running behind  the wagon, desperate to get up with the others. He engages in destructive procrastinating behaviors to avoid the stress of the expectations he has set up for himself. 

Present Me want to stop existing because he can't stand the thought of being Present Me for the next 20 to 30 years. 

Present Me struggle to make choices for the fear of the uncertain outcome. Every simple everyday choice becomes a mountain to climb. Present Me don't ask for help, for the fear of being a burden. Present Me don't have the strength to appreciate, or help, other people.  

**Future Me** is an adult. Future Me knows that the most important thing to do every day is to forgive himself for the shortcomings of yesterday. 

Future Me sees the tasks that is in front of him and focus to perform the task to the best of his ability. No more, no less. Future Me finally has learned to quiet his inner voice. 

Future me realizes the running is futile. Stop to get his heart rate down. Take a breath and then builds his own wagon with the help of someone else that's in the same position.  Future Me knows it will probably not be a perfect wagon, but at least it will move forward, albeit a bit wonky.  Future Me Appreciate peoples existence in his life. He is extreme grateful to be alive one more day.

911,t3_dibd1e,Having one of those days,"A bit of a rant, sorry if it's long. 

Today I'm just having one of those days where I'm depressed about everything. I feel like my support system is total trash. I grew up an only child with a narcissistic mother and an amazing dad. Father passed away four years ago and he was my world, one of my primary go-to persons. Which is why I feel like I lost my entire family when he died. 

Right now the closest friends I have are a friend who lives out of state that I've known for about ten years, my godmother who's getting old, and the person I've been dating for over a year. So...not super dependant. 

This is why it's so hard for me to make big life decisions that will move my life forward (get a better job, start my Master's degree, figure out what I want to do with my life) because I have to basically make them myself. The types of people out there that have gone through a thousand failures to have that one success have done so because they have a solid support system. You always hear them say ""I couldn't have done it without these (long list of) people."" I have a very, very short list. 


I've also realized that I lean on significant others to take the place of this missing support system, which I recognize is unhealthy and unfair to say the least. But I have little other choice, what else am I supposed to do? 

I have a community of people my age that I'm part of, but it takes years to get to know someone long enough to feel like someone I can trust completely. But those people still can't really replace the bond of family that most people have to rely on, and will rightly distance themselves if they sense I'm being too ""needy"". 

I feel like if I had a healthy support system a lot of little - medium daily life things wouldn't feel so catastrophic. But I grew up emotionally and financially poor, and continue to be emotionally broke. You know how people who don't have money will spend whatever they make right away on things, because of the ""I have a resource and I'm going to use it while it's here before it's gone"" mentality? That's how I am about emotional integrity. I take what I can get, even if it'll potentially hurt me down the road, because it's a ""need it now"" mentality instead of ""let's be frugal in a smart way/not spend everything on short-term highs"". 

Does anybody else feel like they don't have a great support system, and it contributes to wether you have healthy/unhealthy coping mechanisms? How am I supposed to thrive when I struggle to survive?",depression
912,t3_dicf6z,God dammit,"I thought I was getting better. If you look at my post history, I was the lowest I had ever been. My psychiatrist increased my dosage and after a week, the effects kicked it and I was feeling alive again. It was beautiful. 

Now, a week and a half later, I’m sliding backwards again. It’s been a fast decline over the past 4 days. I couldn’t go to class today because I was just too goddamn exhausted, even though I had gotten plenty of sleep. Depression does that. I got myself out of bed, brushed my teeth and my hair, then when it came time to get dressed, I just couldn’t do it. I fought it so hard but my body was like lead. I gave up and I’ve been laying in bed for the past four hours and plan to stay here for another two.

My mom is mad that I skipped class (“you only have two months left!! You can’t be missing class!”) but I don’t have the heart to tell her that I’m in rough shape again. She has enough to worry about.

Recently I feel like my friends mental illness has been getting worse, she won't listen to anything I say she is refusing to listen. She has contacted the schools social worker for help but that's as far as she has gone, I don't think she is allowed to get a therapist. 

I know her anxiety is making her think these things, such as ""Everyone thinks I am stupid"", ""I'm not loved by anyone"", ""I'm ugly"", and none of those things are true and I tell her that but she refuses to believe it. I know I can't force anyone to listen to me and believe me, I also know I can't help everyone. 

I am just concerned, I don't know what to do at this point. She has been going through so much, she has been figuring some things out on her own and I'm proud of her! But I feel like we can't have a normal conversation anymore because all we ever talk about is our depression/anxiety. I feel like I've been drifting away from her and it's not a nice feeling. I don't know how to tell her this without making her feel like she's a burden, because she's not. I love her so much but when she has mental breakdowns, it affects my own mental health and I don't think that's healthy.

918,t3_diiij5,"I'm stuck in this cycle of guilt, isolation, and depression","Today I looked around and realized just how isolated from everyone I am. I got a new job, one that I've been wanting for a while, but it made me realize how much I rely on my coworkers from my old job to fill my social interaction quotas. I saw them day in and day out and now I work 8-4:30 and realize that I have no one to spend time with. And I start to doubt that they want to spend time with me outside of work. I asked if I could join their workout group, they said yes and proceeded to never invite me along. Just the other night they post in Snapchat the fun night they had together while I stayed home.

So I hide from social media, because I don't want to see and because the prospect of actually interacting with people for some reason makes me feel so incredibly drained. My phone buzzes and buzzes but I just don't reply or bother looking at it. One of my friends broke up with their boyfriend and was/is feeling upset over it and even then I only spared a couple messages. I should be able to reach out and send a text or something but instead all I do is sit alone.

So I feel guilty, because I'm sure that someone somewhere is worried about me and yet I'm not saying a word to show that I'm even alive. I feel guilty for letting myself down when it comes to taking care of myself. I keep wanting to start exercising but I can't bring myself to do anything because I don't want to go alone, but alone is all that I am. I haven't drank in months and yet all I want to do is down a bottle of something alcoholic and I feel guilty. I feel guilty because my grandfather died yesterday and I feel absolutely nothing and he would probably be ashamed of me, because I am.

I feel alone, friendless, listless, guilty, and perpetually exhausted. It takes so much effort to get up in the morning and summon the energy to fake my way through 8 hours of training at my new job, and then I come home and crash. At this point I just wish I would fade away or stay asleep or something so I just didn't have to feel this way anymore.

919,t3_difm71,How can I tell my friend I have severe depression? (Or should I tell her at all),"A few weeks ago I had a huge mental breakdown (I’ve been feeling depressed for probably way over a year now, but recently it escalated) and I messaged my old therapist. She called me in the morning and we did the phq9 test together, which I scored a 20 on putting me in the severely depressed range. I’m trying to find a day I’m free where I can get some meds, unfortunately I’m in lectures most days which I hate missing and the doctors are closed on weekends. 

I have maybe one close friend at uni, she’s on my course (I dunno if she considers me the same way cuz she’s really close with her housemates). I’ve opened up to her about a few things, but never anything like this. I know they say it’s good to open up to friends about your depression but I’m honestly scared. As far as I’m aware she’s never experienced mental health issues, so it’s not like she’ll have a great deal of understanding. 

To put into perspective how my depression affects me daily, I wake up everyday and I feel like shit, and that feeling never stops. A lot of the time when I’m alone I feel on the verge of tears. Ever since I’ve arrived at university I’ve felt unwanted and unimportant; all my friends (even those who also have Asperger’s like me) have a nice group of friends but I don’t. I have friends, but no really close ones. This has caused the issue of me struggling to find people to live with in housing for next year, and the whole situation fills me with so much anxiety and dread because I was in the same situation last year and I had multiple panic attacks over it. 

Anyway, I don’t know if I should tell her or not, I see her pretty regularly. I’m scared of telling people in case they treat me differently, even if they’re just trying to be nice I want someone to treat me well without knowing I have depression. 

I just wanted to be happy at university because I’ve gone through a lot, I really pulled the short straw and the fact that I can’t take how awful my first year was back breaks my heart (my flatmates bullied me). I feel heartbroken everyday that this is my life right now, and I’ve honestly tried everything I can to make my experience better. 

Sorry for going on a tangent, I don’t know what to do. 

I’m 20F btw and I’m my second year of university in the UK",depression
920,t3_dido9b,I'm very depressed and I'm seriously considering hanging myself,"Trigger warning I suppose...


I don't know what to say, other than I know that my depression centers around the ever-present dread that I know that I will not be capable of having a functional life after I finish college.  Or let alone accomplish the things I want.  I feel like I am a failure because I am.  I'm a senior, nearly 30, gone through a lot of shit that's too personal to post here... And I'm struggling through it.  I can't shake the... Not the feeling... The knowledge, that I won't be hireable.  Because here I am, yet again, for the thousandth time, *not* working on an important assignment that's due by tonight. And, instead of actually fucking doing it, I have to decide to be depressed about the fact that I'm not doing it.  But I know it's a lot more complicated than that.  I mean how ironic is that?  Seriously.  That's the kind of mental warfare I go through constantly.


The odd thing is that I know completely why I'm suicidal, I know it like I know my favorite book.  But I can't really express it, it's just too complex.  But I can say that a large percentage of it has to do with the above, and the reason that's important is because, for other people, I don't think depression is like that.  Because most people I've encountered or heard of that are depressed have good jobs, a good life, more or less.  Whereas here I am, depressed because I'll probably never even *get* to that level.  


Another facet of it is due to the fact that I feel stuck in my prospective job field and I don't particularly like it.  It's too late to switch courses now, I'm a senior in college, I'm not going to waste thousands of non-existent dollars to start over again.  More over, I can't, because it'd drive me insane.  I fucking hate college. And, who's to say that I won't just also hate the thing I choose next? Is there really no possible way for you to fucking discover the thing you actually enjoy doing except by pure fucking chance?  Coincidence? How the hell do people ever take it for granted if they found what *actually* suits them? Honestly, at this point, I think I could be more happy being a trash man than all this professional bullshit I'm learning in school.  


And I just... Can't take this.  I feel like I'm not cut out for this shit.  I'm not.  It's as simple as that. And I probably won't ever be.  And no matter how hard I work I'll never be enough and I'll never be able to affect the changes I want to affect because this world is rigid and designed towards cruelty and everything just fucking sucks.  There are problems that our fucking *grandparents* saw and they're still not fixed, how the hell could I have ever assumed I'd be good enough to tackle them?  I mean Jesus Christ.  So what's the point.  Ending it would be the more merciful thing for me and this world",depression

But for the past almost 4 years I’ve been spiraling. I’ve been on medication for about 3 years of that. Been to therapy and talked to family I trusted. 
Now I have lost really everything. That great job is no more. My fiancé is now my ex. She’s moved on and I just feel like whoever I do meet next I won’t be much for. Granted I know I need to be in a better place for that. Which is why I’ve decided I can’t date right now.
Since I’ve been jobless all I’ve been able to do is just lay around. No energy. I can’t say that I don’t have fleeting moments of laughter or happiness. But it’s like I can feel it for a second then it falls through my fingers. I’m numb inside for the most part. I have a mask. And just like now. There are times where I can’t keep the mask together and cracks appear on it.
I guess I’m just at a loss. I’ve already been to the hospital for the suicidal thoughts and self harm. I’m already going to be checking myself in the next few days because it’s back like it was then. I just don’t see it getting better while I’m here on earth. I have my faith in God that is practically the only thing that is there and sometimes I feel like I even isolate myself from that.

I honestly cannot bring myself to study and I don’t even find solace in what I call my hobby, and it’s probably best if it just ends here. I’m already contemplating dropping out, finding a simple job and move out of my parents house just to move from the negativity that I associate with the place.

I’m embarrassed. I am addicted to alcohol and marijuana. I am still addicted to smoking even though I haven’t had a cigarette in awhile. I have ridiculous mood swings that could knock you on your ass. The anger I express to fellow colleagues at work for absolutely no reason is completely uncalled for. It’s ugly and I hate myself for not being able to control it.

I write lists. Excessively. I even have to add “shower/shave” and “prep lunch” so that when I cross everything off at the end of the evening I can reward myself by eating a weed gummy and falling away into the careless rest of my evening. I barely answer texts in the evenings. I never answer the phone after 7. I just hibernate in my bed by myself and watch a movie I’ve probably seen 10 times (that took me 45 minutes to decide on).

I tell myself the reason I’m not signing up for softball anymore is because I’m trying to get pregnant and I don’t want to be out the cash if I have to stop playing after paying league fees. This is a lie. My anxiety level for the entire day leading up to having to play a game that I could be awful at that would negatively impact the rest of the team almost makes me physically ill. The thought of performing badly and embarrassing myself is so overwhelming that I choose not to play. My favourite sport. It’s literally been my favourite sport since I was young and now I’m giving that up because I’d rather be alone in bed.

I worry about everything. Right now I’m lying I’m bed worrying about the fact that I agreed to sub for indoor ball tomorrow and hoping that my back pain will not hinder me, and worrying about going to wings on Thursday and it not starting until 7 pm which is pretty late for me as I’d rather be settling down at that time, and worrying about the fact that my husband hasn’t cleaned the hottub in a few weeks, and worrying about the fat rolls on my stomach, worrying about the mound of work waiting on my desk for me tomorrow morning, worrying about getting pregnant, worrying about not getting pregnant. But most of all: I’m worrying what’s next? What am I actually excited about? What am I looking forward to? I don’t have an answer.

I’ve talked to my doctor(s) about this in the past. They’ve all seen me at my highest highs, so they refuse to believe I could ever have lows like this. They claim that these feelings are “situational”. For awhile I thought I could believe that... Until I started blaming other people for my unhappiness. It’s not my husbands fault. It’s not my bosses fault. It’s not my coworkers fault. This shit is all on me. And I have no idea what to do about it. I have no idea how to “feel better”.",depression

Tl;dr: did your body adjust and stop being utterly exhausted at any point? If so, how long did it take? If not, please tell me yout experience lmao. I'm drowning.

I have slept better than I have in years, and I am immediately starting to feel a bit bubbler and a lot less hopelessly empty.

However.

I feel like fucking shit.

I can barely open my eyes in the morning, and I am a morning person, so this sharp change in combination with a job I have to get up at 4:30a for fucking sucks.

All day, I am groggy and tired and do not have the energy to even respond to texts let alone do my schoolwork - and keep in mind: I am taking 30mg of IR Adderall twice a day!

But the worst part is the evenings. I have been struggling for the last year with this extreme fatigue that has been setting in everyday around 12p-2p. I had sort of gotten a grip on it? But these meds have thrown that in the fucking garbage.

I feel like I have the fucking flu the later it gets. I have hot flashes, I cannot think straight, I am so fucking exhausted I had to pause getting out of my car and close my damn eyes for a second!

Like. I am getting so far behind on schoolwork. (Which, notably, I do not feel...almost any anxiety about? No knot in my stomach like I always have had with my GAD. But I don't know if that's because of trazodone or because I am too fucking foggy to focus on that reality.)

As far as physical health/environment goes btw. I regularly workout, lost 23lbs this year. I have a sleep routine where I turn off my phone an hour before bed and wind down. I eat the same pretty good diet, using LoseIt to track nutrition. 

However. This fucking week. I have not been able to muster the energy to do ANY of that. I crawl into bed in my fucking clothes, shivering and aching like the flu. I can barely find the energy to eat let alone do cardio.

I called my psych six minutes after they opened this morning, had to leave a message that sounded pretty desperate and pathetic - they did not get back to me. Ugh.

I physically feel so, so awful. And I do not have the God damn time to be doing nothing with my time!

So, did this stop for you? Does it get better? If so, how long did it take? If not, please tell me your experience.

PS: I tried taking it ""as needed"" on a night I felt exhausted - woke up at 4a in a fucking panic and couldn't fall back asleep, which made me more panicked. Took 25mg of tradozone, tossed and turned and sweated for half an hour, so took the other half. So.",depression

I am exhausted from studying so much, striving for nothing.  So that in the end they designate a person because they have contacts.  I feel that society and the work environment rejects people with emotional difficulties.  They are not allowed to overcome.  It is a kind of social Darwinism.

I put on an imitation of myself while doing this and try to be my best for others, but I know that isn't me. There are very few people I am comfortable being myself around and even then I rarely open up to them. I am paranoid about most of my friends being fake because they don't know me, they know my act. I want to try to stop this act, but it seems impossible. I distract myself with music and hobbies, but once they're gone I am back. I almost made a terrible mistake, but was able to stop myself from doing it because I still had some sense, but I am afraid of what I would've done if I was so hopeless that I lost any sense of control. This irks me to the core and even though I know that I stopped myself and I am trying to be a better person, but I still doubt that I am. My happiness is just little blips on a radar that fade away quickly and then I'm drowning again. The only thing that stops me from self harm is that I am afraid of the pain.

My overall depression comes and goes in waves for the most part. The one thing that seems to stay the same, the one problem that I can’t seem to fix with the help with my therapist, is the sadness and depression from loneliness. I’ve been living where I am for three years now, and can’t seem to make a single friend, let alone find someone interested in dating me. I work a lot to try to cover the pain, and it works to an extent, but it makes me doubly tired to do anything in my off time. All I can manage is to do basic errands and appointments with my therapist, dentist appointment, that sort of thing. I have the time to do other things, I just can’t bring myself to do them, be it due to fatigue, or that any activity I would do keeps me alone anyway, so what’s the point? Like others here, the suicidal ideation is strong. I’ve written the occasional letter over the years, but I’ve never figured out how to end it. I won’t risk taking someone else’s life in the process or giving them permanent mental scarring to end my own pain.  I know plenty of people on social media to reach out to, but they all live far away.

954,t3_dihwk0,I need advice on my relation ship with my girlfriend that has depression,"Let me preface this by saying that I am not depressed. My girl friend is.

Me(18) and my girlfriend(18) have been dating for over two years now. I know that most people will probably discount this post alone based on our ages but I plead that you keep reading.

When we first started dating it was amazing and after awhile we became inseparable. People always assume to see us together because we’re always together. As of now both of us are at our local community college but I plan on only finishing this year and leaving for a university. She plans on doing the same. Sometimes I feel as if I’m a sponge for all the negative energy. Ive always been there for her and always will but it feels as if I’m always stepping on egg shells. I’m getting tired and more irritable. She is on medication and goes to therapy, but constantly lies to her therapist about her actual thoughts. She has cut before and still does while trying to hide it from me. It doesn’t happen often but about once or twice a month depending. Ive tried to help her as much as I can with her fight. Ive read her nightly stories of people who have overcome depression; Ive gotten her a journal to write down thoughts and shes agreed to share her journal with her therapist, but has not as of now.  I feel like I’m constantly setting myself on fire to keep her warm but I can’t stand to see her suffer by herself.

I voiced some, not all, of my thoughts to her and asked her to start talking to her therapist instead of just going through the motions of therapy and also asked that she think of sharing what’s going on with her to a close friend or someone that she trusts. She refuses to talk to her parents about it and I can’t blame her. Her mom, while she does care and has recently become very involved in mental health issues in schools, she constantly seems like she cares more about her image than her daughter. Not much has changed after voicing my thoughts and now I’m scared that the relationship isn’t going to get better. I’m afraid that I’ll spend the rest of my life stepping on egg shells and trying to avoid saying what I actually feel to avoid her having a panic attack and breaking down. I have to be so careful with my tone, what I say, and even how I look like I’m feeling just to try to avoid her having an attack. It’s beginning to feel like too much.

I’m thinking over the decision of a break up, and that’s why I’m posting this. I don’t know what to do, I feel trapped but what if I leave her and she does something bad. I would be destroyed knowing that it was my fault. I want her to be okay, but I think I need to start worrying about myself. I’m scared of what to do and I’m scared I’m gonna hurt her to the point she won’t recover. What if she can’t get better and this break up is the final straw. I’m scared guys.

Edit: I forgot to mention she doesn’t just have depression, but ocd, anxiety, and PANDAS. All of these have been diagnosed and she is on medication.",depression
955,t3_dicx86,I think I am giving in to my negative feelings,"Hello, I just would like to write about how I’m feeling to see if I am just thinking irrationally or not. I am currently a sophomore in college and I just completely hate it. I can’t motivate myself to do any work and it just keeps piling on. I can’t make any friends, I’ve tried joining clubs and all that but whatever, I really don’t care about making friends anymore. I just wish I was able to do my work it’s just that I don’t care anymore. I have realised that all of my work is just going to lead to nothing. I can’t see myself having a career or a happy life, I really think I’m just going to kill my self after college so what is the point in even trying anymore? Last year wasn’t great for me, but I still had hope that things would get better. This year the hope is honestly lost, I feel like my brain only works at a 30% capacity while being enclosed in fog, it’s terrible I can’t even think. I really don’t see how anything will ever change. 

Things have been like this for years and instead of getting better they’re just getting worse. I am bored with life, I don’t see any potential in it. Everything is just a variation of the same general life that you’ve lived up to this point. No matter what my future holds it will still be nothing but me walking around doing my daily tasks, every conversation is just a slight variation on one I’ve had before, nothing is new. There is nothing impressive about human life it is just a boring routine. Currently I am in college just to eventually reach my own boring routine and the process of college just sucks. 

I wish I was a kid again and the world felt new and I didn’t have to think about my future and how much of a failure I am as a person. Every day I just find myself looking back on the times when I was very young and those memories are slowly getting further and further away and my future just looks bleaker and bleaker. I really will be surprised if I am alive for much longer, I feel like my days are truly numbered. I live as if I am dying, but I really think I am anyways. What the point in living any other way? As I’ve said before life is nothing but a boring routine I have not experienced anything that proves this otherwise. I am working towards nothing, just more despair.

 I wish I wasn’t like this, I always blame everything on my self. I do have many short comings and failures, I have no ability to speak with people and make friends, I used to be smart but that is leaving me too, I used to play sports something I wish that I would have stuck with. The world is just so limited, humans are so limited, the best possible life, being rich and having no worries is still limited by the boring human existence. I hate it all I love my family and that is it, I only feel anger when looking or thinking about other people. The few friends that I have I value as well, and I value them much more than they value me. This is another thing that saddens me, I used to have some close friends but I feel afraid to even speak with them anymore, I am so pathetic and have no accomplishments. 

I truly believe the problem is that I was meant to either have never been born, or born into some other existence, one that is actually interesting and meaningful. I love my family and if it weren’t for them I fully believe that I would have put a bullet through my brain, but I don’t know how much longer I will feel their love. I am on a path to nowhere and I will continue to disappoint them. At least if I break from my family it will be easier for me to die. 

It just breaks my heart to think about my mom. I feel like my only reason i live is for her. I know it devastates her to see me like this. All through high school I was just a sad person, i got into drugs, my mom was just devastated she does whatever she can to make me happy. She wants me to be happy at college so badly and I always tell her I am and she believes me I think. I am always afraid to come home because I don’t want my parents to see through my lies, but I think I am actually pretty good at hiding it. It just breaks my heart, my mom says she wants me to “have the college experience” and all I do is sit and do nothing.

I don’t feel sad as often as I used to, instead a lot of the time it is anger and frustration. I say some hateful things and have some hateful thoughts, but I believe they’re normal and just s product of my frustration. I just hate being alive and I hope that I can get my fucking act together because I am completely pathetic",depression

957,t3_dibj0r,Guilt living,"Long story. You may read if you want to give any suggestions.

I am 23 rn. I don't have siblings. I felt lonely as a kid. my parents planned on a single child as they knew the difficulties of having siblings and having to share everything. They always had my back. But, I still needed someone to share my secrets and the feeling of having someone to having your back after your parents. I always had my cousin or my neighbor when we went out on a trip or outing so that i don't get bored. 

I have done my high school and went abroad to study medicine. That's when I hit 18 and started to know things. My environment was always good going. That's where I faced my first depression cuz I myself separated from my group of friends as I thought I was being taken for granted. Took a while to get out of it. Had a good life there. Graduated and came back to my country.

This is where adulthood hit me. I have always travelled in packs; school, college, University. I never had any aim. Just wanted to travel with the packs/ go with the flow cause I felt secure. Now I'm on my own. This scares me. All of my childhood friends are working, some have settled in another country. I'm still here, always in nostalgia that how things have changed in last 6 years. Still dependent on allowance. I'm unable to study for my exam which is gonna be in few weeks. I'm scared about my future. I don't know if I can make it. Everytime I open my books to study I feel like killing myself because there is so much to study and I am unable to understand the same thing that I studied previously.

This gets me stressed and gives suicidal thoughts. My parents have lived a good and respected life. I want to give them back the happiness but I'm unable to. I don't even think that I'm gonna be a good doctor. I don't wanna change my field of study because of hopes my parents and people around have on me. This doesn't get me motivated but infact gets me depressed.  There's always a second thought on a decision I make and it's like a mini battle inside my brain. I always have a feeling of not achieving anything in my life. There's nothing I can be proud of. I subconsciously keep scrolling through social media for a long time just to avoid looking at the books. I'm stress eating and have gained 8 kg in 30 days.

Even rn I'm writing this with my books in front of me. I planned on using anti depressant but the side effects it has kept me away.

I am still surprised by the fields my friends chose. We all travelled together but they all had a plan and an aim. But I just kept living in the moment. I never cared about the future. Once I'm here, I'm still looking into the past fucking up my future.",depression

1020,t3_diya1j,How to deal with severe free time anxiety?,"It sounds really dumb, I’m sure, but the past few months I’ve been dealing with a really bad flare up of symptoms I’ve had off and on all my life. I can’t decide what to do with my free time. 

I know it probably sounds arbitrary and ridiculous, but when I have time to myself without my girlfriend, I think of all the things I want to do and then end up forcing myself to do one, all the while feeling like I could be doing other things, worrying that I’ll regret not doing something else, and ultimately feeling only halfway into what I do end up do omg because I have a sense of almost obligation and I have trouble investing and being focused. 

As an example, I had a free evening last night. I’ve been wanting to watch a movie, but also wanting to read a book, and at the same time wanting to play a game. I sat for maybe 30 minutes trying to decide how to best maximize my time, until I finally watched a movie. I enjoyed it, but I also couldn’t stop thinking about how I maybe could’ve been enjoying my book more, and maybe I should’ve played a game since I may have less time to do that in the next couple of days. And then there’s the ever present thoughts of “why am I even doing this? Is this really worthwhile? Am I wasting my time?” And what’s worse, the next day, I may feel like “man, last night I wish I could’ve done this instead when I had the chance”. 

It even leads to more intrusive thoughts about my life in general and whether I’m bored with my relationship, bored with life, bored with my social situations, etc. I’ll see people I don’t know on social media doing things I’d love to be doing and think “I wish I was doing that with those people”. Totally crazy I know. 

It’s been manifesting as a need to hang out with friends too, because I feel like it’s something I really want to do, and when they can’t or the plans change, it makes me even more stressed. 

It’s really exhausting, and my medicines (buspar and trintellix) don’t seem to be helping. 

Does anyone else deal with this, and if so, how do you cope/make a decision and be happy with it?",Anxiety

I get anxious about my relationship. That we both work too much at different times and talk too little when we are together. 

I get anxious about not using my free time doing something productive. 

I get anxious about spending money so I stay home. But then I get anxious about being at home because I like being outside. 

There’s so many things I get anxious about; these are just to name a few. Every little thing adds up, and now I feel like I’m being crushed by the weight of my worries. 

I know these are things I should talk to someone about, but I feel like I can’t talk about it without making it sound less serious than it feels. I’m really bad at expressing my emotions, so to me it just makes sense to not express them at all. But it’s making each day harder.

1027,t3_dj2lps,Some tips for health anxiety,"This is from the perspective of someone who developed dormant anxiety in my teenage years which was triggered after a mushroom trip. Those tips I had to learn on my own and I really hope it helps someone else. Here goes:

-sit down, take a breather for a second

-you ARE gonna die. You aren't immortal, none of us are. This is the reality we all have to accept. It's the curse of consciousness

-accept that your body is 80% in autopilot. Which means you trying to take back control from a place you never had control of is a waste of time. Focus on the 20%.

-go see a doctor. Get yourself checked out. Google will 100% of the time make your anxiety worse

Okay now here are the actually helpful tips:

-DO NOT try to medicate it right away, even if a doctor prescribes you something. It's just a band aid that'll end up doing more harm than good. You may still have the power inside you to fix it.

-consider natural supplements like relaxen and melatonin. The former will help during the day if it gets hard to control and melatonin for those sleepless nights. But don't abuse it since you'll build a tolerance.

-for me falling asleep meant anxious feeling would haunt me about 5 min before I fell asleep. Every night. I'd even get some very vivid dream like imagery popping into my head (which can get scary). A good trick is to accept those feelings and tell yourself ""there they are. That means I'm gonna fall asleep soon"". Which meant I started expecting them and even was looking forward to them. When I wasn't scared anymore the pre-sleep anxiety just stopped

-every time you start feeling anxious, tell yourself this mantra ""stop lying anxiety. You haven't killed me thus far, you aren't going to do it now.""

-treat your anxiety like a crying kid in the back of your mind.  Giving it attention feeds the anxiety (which is why it's so easy to spiral into a panic attack). Just like a capricious kid, you need to adopt a ""fuck it"" mentality. Even when alone, the satisfaction you get from ignoring it like a champ will help a lot

-practise mindfulness. This one it hard to explain but simply put: your brain, when it detects something's wrong, will go into ""hyper vision"" mode to try to figure out what the problem is. This is why every little symptom worries you. What you need to do is: 1. Look at the symptom. 2. Acknowledge it. 3. Let it go. A good mental trick is to think of it like if you are were a thrift shop with the most boring stuff in it. Once you master that technique you will be able to ignore the symptoms to a point where even the beggining of a panic attack will just wash over you like a wave on a rock. 

-it's important to have a support group (even one person is enough) but it's even more important not to abuse it. If you keep talking about your anxiety it keeps it alive. Remember, the whole point is to leave it behind.

-adopt the ""I'll worry about it when I get to it""mentality for everything in your life, not just the anxiety. This one is particularly hard but it's a fake it till you make type of deal. 

-live your fucking life. you only have the one. You won't be reincarnated into someone else and have another go at it. You need to figure what's important to you and pursue it. 

Anyways that's all I got. I might add to the post if some other tips come back to me. I love you all and good luck!

1029,t3_dj1dk6,Diagnosed with severe Anxiety disorder: is this how my whole life is going to be? Panic? All the time?,"Hi. I'm a 20 year old girl with bad anxiety. I feel like I have no way out. Sorry for the wall of text. If anyone reads this. thank you

My anxiety stops me from making friends, new jobs--it's even stopping me from starting new hobbies like streaming and making vids which I've always been interested in. I feel trapped inside my own head. no matter what I tell myself, what the therapist says to me, and the meds I'm on. The three different prescriptions made me feel even worse being on after 7 months. And I felt even worse getting off of the meds. I'm too scared to do anything. Going to therapy is nerve wrecking. Every. Single. Time. Opening up to a stranger about the embarrassing fears you have. I can't even call a suicide hotline. I have a fear of calling. Yikes

I've done 3 job interviews and was 2/3 successful. The first job interview I was so freaked out, that my left eye lost partial vision for 6 minutes. I stuttered a lot, but I got the job though. I thought I could finally relax, But then everyday I was anxious to go to work. The gut feeling walking through the front doors everyday. For no reason. Everyday for 1 year. Until, I just couldn't do it anymore. I tried so badly. I want to succeed. But that gut wrenching feeling and panic everyday drained my mental health. I am a mute. Always to myself. Too scared to speak up. Kept asking myself why? Why won't it go away? There's nothing wrong happening... Going insane hating myself. 

My anxiety is holding me back in life. I hate it so much. It's uncontrollable. No matter what I tell myself. The reality that the only person to blame for my laziness and lack of progression is... Myself.

 I don't want to use any excuses. No matter how much I've been exposing myself and trying to get over it, it just gets worse... 

Is this just who I am? 
It feels like I'm coming to terms that this will be the rest of my life? And I don't think I can handle it... 

Now, like a bad heartbreak, I'm waiting it out. Waiting out if my anxiety will just pass. And I'll be able to live my life. I don't know what else to do. I don't even enjoy the things I like anymore like video games or movies. Brain keeps telling me I'm wasting time. I'm wasting my life. Now I am just laying in bed waiting for it to get better. But I think Im honestly just defeated. which scares me too LOL. fuck

Every single thing for me is a battle and I hate being this pathetic pussy to scared do anything,

 too scared of death, but I don't live life... Welp.

I even admit that anxiety is part of the problem but it just feels like I’m not being heard at all.

1031,t3_dizkt7,Why won’t the panic stop?,"A lot my anxiety is health based. Some people call me a hypochondriac, but the last time I had a therapist they mentioned something called “PsychoSomatic Symptom Disorder”. It was never officially diagnosed as I had to stop treatment due to losing insurance. I have however been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. So the former is a real possibility. 

Anyway, to my current situation: I work late nights at a Halloween event and I have to dress business casual. Most of the time I wear skirts or dresses as their easy to move in and it’s been warm. I have been eaten alive by mosquitoes. 
I thought nothing of it until my coworker posted an article that mosquitoes 2 blocks away tested positive for some crazy disease. The symptoms were fever, nausea, brain swelling, and some other terrifying things. 

I cannot get it off my mind. My heart has been racing for almost an hour and I’m trying not to cry because I’m visiting with company. All of this has given me a headache and I can’t stop connecting it with that disease. I’m over thinking everything my body is feeling and doing. 

I’m so tired of feeling crazy and being terrified of everything. I just want to be “normal”. Or at the very least brush it off and not worry about it. 
I need to find an outlet. Most medications I’ve tried made me violently ill, and the only time I was able to cope was when I used to use THC/CBD or when I had therapy. My company drug tests and I can’t afford therapy at the moment so all I can do is just pour my feelings and hope someone can tell me that I’ll be okay, because I really don’t feel like I am. 

Thank you for reading all the way through if you did. I appreciate this space for allowing me to just get things off my chest in a semi-anonymous way.",Anxiety
1032,t3_dj2zfz,"Is there a name for ""bipolar anxiety,"" where my anxiety is non-existent but then suddenly becomes unbearably bad?","So at this present moment, I feel no anxiety whatsoever. I feel completely fine, and thinking about things in my life - my health, my plans for the future, my friends and family - does not cause me any panic or stress whatsoever.

But, I have this issue where my anxiety can be triggered by an external event and it can literally destroy me in an instant and last for weeks. My issue is with academics; when I'm in a class, I need to feel like I have some idea of what's going on or have some way to succeed.

If I feel completely lost, I get anxious about the class, but when I say anxious, I mean the following: for weeks, I will not eat enough food and lose several pounds, I will get \~2 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky, I will lock myself in my dorm and sob, and I will think seriously about suicide. Things I didn't care about before - how many friends I have, what people think of me, the meaning of life - will suddenly stress me out and cause an existential crisis. I cannot express enough that *I go from a perfectly normal person to a highly depressed, highly anxious, low-functioning human being and all it takes is ONE CLASS where I have no idea what's going on.*

Here's the thing too: my fears are totally unfounded. I have a 3.93 GPA. I have never gotten anything below a B+ and I go to a top 20 university in the United States. All it takes is that I perceive a class as being difficult and that I am lost, and I can't handle it anymore. I go haywire.

Throughout college I've had to navigate around this. I used to be studying Computer Science (and still wish I had the mental strength to pursue it), but I reached the beginning of my fourth semester and had a complete meltdown. My family and I decided I switch to something easier - Economics - and this put me at ease for another 3 semesters. Then, I by chance took an econ class (my last core class I needed) with a professor who was unbelievably bad and gave an unbelievable amount of work, and I completely panicked again. The solution was simply to drop the course, despite this putting me in a tricky spot having to take it in my last semester.

After I made these moves, I went from suicidal to perfectly fine. What do you call this? Where an external event threatens some part of my subconscious so much that I become majorly mentally ill? Right now, I think back to these events and wonder how I let myself get so worked up. I sit here with my now-normal brain and say ""why can't you just, I don't know, wait around and see how the course goes? Or just accept that it's ridiculously hard and try your best anyway?"" I try and convince myself that this is all a mistake and that I could go back into Computer Science no problem, but I know it's a lie; I am one class away from a collapse at all times.

tl;dr - when a class makes me feel lost and confused, I go from perfectly normal and happy to near-suicidal with anxiety. I have never heard of this ""binary anxiety"" in anyone else and I want to know if there are others who have had this experience",Anxiety

1034,t3_dj1b93,How my anxiety has helped me more than it’s hurt me,"This is my first post on this subreddit, after reading through several post I haven’t really seen anyone with a similar situation, basically everyone has very similar symptoms though, needless to say. But I was rid of anxiety for a good 2 years, and mind you I’m only 17, and suddenly out of nowhere about 4 weeks ago, boom! massive panic attack, my first one. And since than I’ve had about eight, four really bad ones where I genuinely would’ve jumped off a bridge if I had the chance that’s how badly I wanted it to be over, I’ve managed to deal with the panic attacks recently, I know when there coming and I know what to do when they do. But what I’ve realized it that this constant anxiety stemmed from that one panic attack, it was so horrifying I couldn’t stop thinking about it, and the only reason I had the second and third and fourth bad ones was because I was thinking about the one prior, I was worrying about worrying as Alan Watts would say, and for the first three weeks, I couldn’t function, it was like this anxiety I had worked so hard to let flow through me instead of take me over had suddenly punched me in the back of my head, almost as if my brain was trying to tell me something. I don’t get out often, I don’t get exercise even though I could, I don’t function and do things, I don’t try...even though I should, that sudden outburst felt like my brain screaming and crying for help because I wasn’t listening, I eat like shit, I’m lazy, I don’t get out at all, and I’m slowly turning all that around, I’m taking supplements and changing my diet to a more vegan diet, much healthier than how I was eating before, I’m going on runs, I’m going out with my friends any chance I get, which is only once a week but it’s a start, but in the long Tun my anxiety was helpful I’m telling me that I’ve got to change things up ASAP, I tend to ramble on with these, but...anyway, I hope this gets out and I can hear some other perspectives.",Anxiety

The thing is I have it built up in my head that all her friends hate me and think I’m ugly and weird even know we haven’t really talked, but you know, that’s what overthinking does. I’m still not sure if my sister in law asked if I could come or if I was invited by the host of the party. I really did not want to go. I was thinking of every possible scenario in my head, kept thinking that I would mess it up somehow and everyone would hate me and think I’m weird and that I would be by myself the whole party leaning up against a wall or something. 

So after overthinking every possible scenario, I made a excuse and told my sister in law that I was tired and did not want to go. This upset her a great deal. She knows that I have a anxiety disorder and has been trying to help me go out of my comfort zone and to try to help me get a girlfriend and make some friends, which I am thankful for. I bit the bullet and decided to go. It was a clown party so we got dressed up with makeup and headed out and...
I actually had a good time. None of the bad things I thought in my head happened. I had some drinks and smoked some weed with a cool group of people and did some talking. We talked about work and games and stuff. It was definitely not as bad as I made it out to be in my head. 

I give myself props and a pat on the back for going out of my comfort zone. I seem to have a problem with my looks that gives my anxiety. I have been called ugly my whole life and think that people who are attractive look down on unattractive people. I couldn’t rap my head around why I was invited to a party with such beautiful people.

My anxiety is that I get panic attacks when I'm around people like in a bus and in pretty insecure about myself. I don't feel anxious before I go outside or want to do something. I don't have a problem sozializing.
I even got a couple job offers before I really applied for it because they liked me so much.

 I had really good grades in school and after I graduated under the 10 best of the region it all went down. My father has a borderline personality disorder which made it really hard to get along with him (and is probably the trigger of my anxiety). I went to college after that and when  I was there I had a feeling in the back of my mind that told me to go. To go somewhere safe. I ignored that and made a couple friends. After a while the itching in the back of my head went louder and I began sweating in the winter and shaking shortly after that I had the feeling that I don't get enough air. That was my first panic attack.

Now I'm at a point where I was denied by doctors to get medication and on the waiting list for some other and I go rarely outside. A couple times a month and every time I get home again I lock myself into my room shaking make a pillow fortress and cry until I fall asleep.

I always hid my anxiety from anyone who wasn't too close to not notice it themselves. But several weeks ago, after a string of struggles in my personal life- divorce, death, and break-ups were all involved- my anxiety was at an all time high, and I was calling out of work far too often. My HR guy, who I should mention told me when I took this promotion that if I called out at all under this boss I would be fired immediately, sat me down with said boss. Of course I knew exactly what it was about, and honestly I was ready to add ""get fired"" to my list of recent struggles (albeit one I deserved).

They sat me down and handed me a paper with every one of my call-outs or schedule modifications over the last 6 months- I won't lie, it was bad. I felt ashamed. They told me I'd have been fired weeks ago if I were anyone else. (I am a member of a 3 person specialized department and hard to replace). They said it was especially hard because I'm so great when I'm at work, I just can't make it there consistently. 

They asked if there were any health reasons I was calling out so much. Having not said more than one or two words of agreement to this point, I swallowed the lump in my throat and shakily began. I told them that no, there were not physical health issues involved. I said I had been diagnosed with severe anxiety. And explained the personal situations, which to that point I had also not told anyone at work about. I said that sometimes I am just having a really bad day with anxiety and end up calling out. I didn't get too much into specifics, and I really didn't try to make excuses. I said I understood that everyone has their own issues they are dealing with, but I had just been struggling recently. I apologized for inconveniencing my boss and coworker, and I really meant it. At this point of course I still thought this was me being fired.

They told me that while everyone has their own issues, that was a lot for a young guy to be dealing with at once, especially with an anxiety disorder. They said that what i was dealing with *was* a health issue, and asked if I needed any assistance getting help. I told them I felt I was already doing my best to get better, with therapy and medication. They assured me that they'd rather me stay home if I am having a particularly bad day or episode, and we can always work around it- switch that day for a day i was going to have off, etc. 

I was crying the whole time, embarrassingly. But unfortunately it just happens when I talk about the nitty gritty parts of this stuff. And by the end it was half tears of bewilderment that their response had been... understanding and support? For someone that rarely shares this stuff, and thought that it often goes poorly if you do, this really blew me away. I have never felt more supported, and since the meeting, my call outs have dropped mostly back to regular levels- turned out my anxiety over the looming issue didn't help either. And from the company's perspective- they fixed the issue from their side while making a young employee much more loyal to them long-term. It was a total win/win.

If anyone has bothered to read this far, my point is- be honest about your struggles more often. You might be surprised at the response. You also might not be, but then you're just back where you started. But not having to hide these things is such a liberating feeling, and being accepted is amazing.",Anxiety
1051,t3_dixi79,Boyfriend told me anxiety wasn’t real,"For some backstory I’m 19 years old and still don’t have my license. It’s something that makes me feel really bad about myself. I’ve practiced for years now and still can’t do many things that are on the test correctly. I’m super embarrassed by this. It really does consume a lot of my thoughts because I feel like a burden to everyone and I feel immature and stupid because I can’t take myself places. My boyfriend of 4 years offers to try to teach me how to drive, I do okay until we start practicing in the neighborhoods etc. Cars keep coming out of nowhere when I’m trying to parallel park and I start to really get overwhelmed and my anxiety starts going through the roof. (Yes I’ve actually been diagnosed since I was 14) he tells me to stop freaking out and I tell him that this is really making my anxiety act up and I wanna go home. He then proceeds to tell me that I don’t suffer from anxiety because it’s not a real thing. 

I couldn’t help but feel really hurt by this because anxiety has honestly ruined the majority of my life. It’s kept me from doing a lot of things I want to and I hate it so much. I wish I it wasn’t a real thing because my life would be a lot better if it wasn’t. I just feel so hurt by this right now. I don’t know if I’m too sensitive or not.",Anxiety
1052,t3_dird6d,I'm leaving mental health forums (like this one),"Just going through my posts and deleting them has really made me see how much I focus on what's wrong with me, and how intricately I think about it and analyse it. I think for a while, finding people who share your symptoms can reassure you or inspire your recovery, and it can be a really good thing, but I also see a negative aspect of it, where we dwell and dwell together in an echo chamber of our problems... and I think I've done this enough now. The catharsis that comes from expressing my pain, with those who are feeling similar, has been really helpful... but then a moment comes where it's not as helpful as it used to be. And it's then that I realise that it kind of actually drags me down, and keeps me focusing on the bad in my life. It almost makes me feel like my life is bad, if I think about it too much. But it isn't. I've just been thinking about the bad for too long, and not enough of the good, or doing enough of the good stuff. Using forums like this for me becomes addictive. Sometimes I have reached for external support here and on other mental health forums, before I've even asked myself if I have the answer inside. I think that's a really important thing to do, first and foremost.

After so much use, I feel like I stop being as self-reliant as I used to be, because I seek reassurance and company online in these forums so much, that it actually makes me eventually feel weaker and MORE anxious. I end up almost relying on these internet strangers to give me a quick fix over the net; the final word that could fix and heal all this anxiety, OCD, depression, etc... but even amongst all the incredible advice I've received, that one piece of advice that will stop the search never comes, and I don't think it can. Because such is the endless loop that is reassurance-seeking.

And then there's the aspect of drowning myself in healing strategies and techniques. I called a helpline the other day, and they asked me, ""What helpful techniques do you usually use when you get anxiety?"" I said that I really didn't know. Not because I didn't know of any. But because I knew of too many. And this is where I think sometimes more information isn't better. After all these years of reassurance seeking, I probably know hundreds of techniques, but because I know so many, recalling the most helpful is really difficult. From now on, I want to stick to a few tried and tested techniques - my personal favourites - and just STOP searching like something better is always out there. I already have what I need. Maybe some of you do, too.

I think forums like this really do have a use, and I gotta say, this and others have helped me so much in my time on here! But I think, for me, I don't want to stop and stay any more. I  want to focus on what positive changes I can make in my life and go do them, even if I feel a bit shitty along the way. Maybe I can work my issues out on my own. Maybe I'll go to a doctor and get help. Maybe I'll read the books that I own or the notes that I've gathered over the years. I've made a list of my favourite techniques and I'm sticking with those.

I think I'm ready to move on now. Thanks so much guys, and all the best!",Anxiety
1053,t3_dizdnx,Incase this helps anybody at all,"Long time lurker in this subreddit.
Just wanted to share in case this helps anybody at all. 

I'm not sure when my anxiety got so bad - I sense maybe around the time my grandpa got sick and later passed due to cancer. I have struggled with anxiety for years now and it sent me spiralling.
I quit my job, and I switched to online university, staying in my room a lot and not being very social or active on my social media, not talking to anybody for days at a time. 
Essentially I felt myself retreat away from all my responsibilities and I didn't feel like an active participant in my own life anymore. 
With time,  I don't have panic attacks anymore - no more nights spent awake crying over intangible nothings. But my life is very much the same as it was in the peak of my worst anxiety, in that my day to day routine is the same. I still spend a lot of time alone in my own comfortable space and I don't socialise much. 
The only difference is that now I feel that I have strength to do more than survive the day. 

This is what i learnt; 

You don't have to be worried about retreating inwards to heal. You are not losing or giving in to your anxieties, and this does not have to be another source of stress for you. 
I had a psychologist and made sure my close family and friends knew what i was going through so that I wasn't completely alone - I needed to make sure my isolation was not dangerous and was instead productive for me. It is important to see the distinction between isolation that could further reinforce your current mental state and space which could help you grow. This is obviously different for everyone.

Ultimately I took a step back from everything and it was what I needed to do to heal.
I needed time and space away from all the noise and criticism and even just to be in a controlled environment where I wouldn't need to over think every little thing. 
I had been feeling so guilty about letting myself switch to online university because I couldn't handle the day to day interactions anymore on campus.
Everything had seemed to exhaust me at university and I would come home and go straight to bed, overthinking my day until I felt like I was actually losing my mind.
In isolating myself (something I thought would be so detrimental to me)  I had somehow created a safe space for myself away from everything so that I could slowly slowly reintroduce the things that don't seem to cross other people's minds - but have me in a poor mental space. 
I viewed my anxiety not as a part of me but as something I had, like a book on a shelf, sometimes closed and sometimes, given the right circumstances, knocked off the shelf onto the floor,  paper flying everywhere. 
On the outside I'm sure it looked like I was off grid and disengaged from the outside world but the truth was, I was doing everything I could do to help myself that was within my own capabilities at that time - however small. 
It was enough to do all that I could do, even though it was a lot less than everyone around me. 
It's okay, to create a safe space for yourself if you are struggling.
It doesn't make you any less active in your life, it doesn't make you weak or invalid. In fact, in taking the time and effort to heal, to forgive yourself and learn about what you can and can't handle - you are fostering strength and growth💕

Whatever stage you are at, forgive yourself.
You are human and your journey to personal growth might be different but it's still valid.",Anxiety

It wouldn't be so bad but it basically leaves me a wreck for at least an hour - my legs are shaky, I can't breathe, I get faint and almost pass out, I get a wave of exhaustion....


Usually I can rationalise my thoughts well, but this is more chemical than mental. I know it's because cortisol is high in the morning, I just don't know how to deal with it. I can't keep spending an hour a morning trying not to pass out but I don't know how to stop it, as the anxiety starts before I'm even conscious.

1056,t3_dj2wyd,How do I stop obsessing over my partner's mortality?,"I want to summarize this as much as possible to save you from reading an essay.

I have bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety which welcomes a lot of intrusive thoughts. My childhood (like many others) was *rough* to say the least. Certain events led to the development of my deep, and irrational fear of being abandoned. That being said, my boyfriend, now fiance of 11 years has been absolutely endearing and supportive.

I have terrible separation anxiety from him, and constantly think about the possibility of him dying, whether it be from some kind of cancer, sudden cardiac arrest, falling from somewhere high, choking on food, murder, heavy objects falling on him, a coworker planning something against him, a car accident, you name it. It's fucking morbid... I thought of every possible way to his demise. This makes me overbearing and protective. I'm constantly checking in on him while he's at work, or when I'm in a lecture. He said it doesn't bother him, and even told me he fears the same, which is why he likes to be in constant contact with me, but I feel that my anxiety is a lot more aggressive than his.

He just started his second job (grave yard shift) and it's making my anxiety sky-rocket. He works at the airport, and I'm scared there will be a bomb, coworkers with ill-intent (this is a trend. I seem to have deep distrust toward people surrounding him), or get into a traumatic accident. At this job, he can't always check in with me like at his other one. It's giving me shortness of breath because I don't know if he's okay or not, and my level anxiety is not pretty right now. It's destroying me to the point where I contemplate calling his supervisor to make sure he's alive and well.

I'm not religious, but often pray to God that if he plans on taking my fiance, to just take me instead because I don't want to live after experiencing his death. How do widows move on with life? I wonder this a lot... I guess some people truly are stronger than others.

Him working at his second job is giving me crippling anxiety. I also can't sleep without him, so I stay up finishing my homework or studying, however, it's extremely difficult when all I can obsess over is his safety, and whether he's okay or not. I know this isn't normal, but I don't know how to stop it. I keep checking my phone, but I still haven't got a text from him. How do I stop this?",Anxiety

1064,t3_dj2ciq,A small victory,"TL;DR: actually found a real life use for mindfulness

Tips: 
-practise mindfulness, you won't know it works until it actually does

-if you're having health anxiety, a good trick is to tell yourself to let your body go back to autopilot. You do that by simply observing the process until you get bored/forget about it

So back in july i took an irresponsibly high dose of mushrooms which triggered some pretty rough anxiety and panic attacks (wrote some posts about it some time ago). 
The following months I became hyper aware of every bodily function that had to do with my breathing, heart rate, body temperature and my brain. I truly felt like the mushrooms brought to light the fact that we as humans have in fact very little control of our body and most of it is actually in autopilot. I was desperately trying to gain back control and therefore spiralled pretty fast into suicidal thoughts. 
To me, life wasn't worth living if my body was in a constant state of either fight or flight or depersonalization.

There's a lot more to it but i wanna stick to the positive.

So in august I went to see a doctor and she told me that i should try meditation.
In desperation I tried it. Worked once but didn't help much, or so i thought. 
Until today.
I was in my bed when i felt the wave of anxiety coming in. Usually I'd sit up, clench my fist. Scramble for my phone to put on some meditation music and try to convince myself not to take the lorazepam the doc prescribed (I haven't touched it since i bought it), but this time I just.. let it happen. 
It washed over me, got to the peak where I could feel i might get a seizure (anxiety has common symptoms with epilepsy), then it stopped, my heart rate slowed down, and i was back to the normal ""anxiety simmering in the back of my head"" state. 
See, that thing where you have to be an observer of your own self but detached from it, and that meditation technique where you let your thought come and go as they please but without interacting with them, that's what it was for.
I know this isn't some revolutionary thing. But I'm really glad I was able to win one battle for once.",Anxiety

Ive had this feeling of unrealness for a while on and off the last couple years but never have i had it last longer than a day or two and so im starting to worry that maybe im suffering some sort of brain condition.

I know the chances for me to have a brain problem are low (im only 16 and the only people in my family to develop brain problems are elderly women which lowers my risk and i have no diagnosed congenital difficulties) and the chances to even get a brain issue is just as rare or rarer while the chances that ive developed anxiety are more likely to occur especially at my age but i cant get it out of my head that there is something wrong with my brain.

I cant even get tired without being worried that its being caused by a severe ilness that will kill me, ive been sleeping from 6 am to 4 pm everyday, missing out on everything because im exhausted, i dont know how to stop this and im so tired of this happening. I have some questions for anyone who reads this if you could please answer back that would probably help me out right now

\-I never had any mental issues before but after moving away for the first time, about a month after actually, i now have extremely bad anxiety that is hindering my life, is it normal for anxiety disorders to arise suddenly (i am a 16 year old male if that helps)?

\-What are your symptoms of anxiety? If i hear other peoples experiences it usually helps me stay calm

\-For those who have trouble sleeping, how do you get through it?

\-Could i truly be suffering from a heart problem or brain problem that i am unaware of? should i get checked in your opinions?

\-And finally how do you convince yourself its all okay and nothing is wrong, ive been trying so hard and i just cant do it no matter how much i try?

That said, I'm constantly having to deal with equipment breaking and being scolded each day for missing stuff. Even parts that just take way too long to do in my allotted time. I called my boss asking if I could drop my second shift because it's been a disaster. I'm constantly anxious about it and recently some family troubles have come up requiring me to be around in that time. I keep rushing and missing things at work because of that. I can barely focus on the job, and my heart literally hurts from the anxiety. My manager laughed when I told her I wanted to drop the shift and she didn't seem to realize I just literally couldn't do it. 

So today I just didn't show up to my second shift. I tried to tell her but she said she was in a rush and just hung up before I could. So I just sat in the bathroom at my first shift crying. I haven't cried in so long. Tomorrow will be so bad. I won't be able to sleep at all tonight. If I don't get fired I still just want to quit because the stress is horrific right now and the timing of the shift I just can't do, but she doesn't seem to understand. But I'm terrified of quitting. I'm lucky to be able to quit because I do live at home but it feels so terrible. It's going to be so awkward tomorrow, so hard, and it's all I can think about is going in, being scolded, and me choked up trying to tell her I'm quitting. She's quite a cold woman and it's hard for me to deal with. What's more I'm a tall bearded man but such an anxious mess that I get choked up and literally can't speak when I'm anxious.

i've watched dozens of videos, read countless articles, because i want to make sure i'm taking good care of her. i get so nervous when i don't see where she is. i watch her tail obsessively to try and assess if she's in a good mood. but most of all, i'm so worried i'm not disciplining her correctly while she's a kitten that she's going to grow up a nightmare cat and i'll feel like a failure when my mother and i start to resent her for it. but if i rehome her now, when i haven't even given myself a chance, i'll feel equally a failure. will this feeling go away? do i just need to stick it out? 

are there for sure things i can do to reassure i'm doing a good job? i spent an hour today using cardboard and duct-tape to board up various gaps in the kitchen and it soothed over the concern she'd squeeze behind the appliances.

I even felt progress after my first session. I'm thinking about things a different want and she helped me realize that a lot of people go through it to some extent.

1077,t3_diwb82,Health related panic attacks - please share what has worked for you,"TLDR; I feel hopeless about these attacks. What has and hasn’t worked for you?

I’ve had anxiety since I was young- more specifically panic attacks. It was always around vomiting. I used to be terrified - I would try to control my situations and always have an exit plan. 

About two years ago, on a terrible vacation - it changed to death. Now I panic that my throat will close and I’ll suffocate or that my heart is palpating and it’s going to stop beating. I need to check my pulse. I feel the urgent need to leave and go to the hospital. I’ll work myself up more and more into a full blown panic. 

I’ve only gone to the hospital once for a panic attack - I’ve tried at all costs to not let into the urge to go there. I feel it will be a major loss - I don’t want to make that behaviour “normal”. 

I feel the intrusive and catastrophic thoughts a few times a week. Sometimes it escalated to panic - not always. 

It feels so hopeless in the moment- that I’m certain I will die. When I try to rationalize with myself - I start to think “if you think this is hard just wait until your older and have real heath problems or your family gets sick - then you’ll really have something to be sad about”. 

I find this health anxiety so difficult - it’s not like vomiting where I could tell myself “worst case you vomit” ... for this one —- what—-“worse case..I die?” It’s hard to accept. 

I’m on meds. I did some CBT a year ago and didn’t see much improvement so I stopped. 

I’m wondering - for people who experience health/death anxiety and panic - what helps you in those moments?",Anxiety

I recently started working as a substitute teaching assistant for my local school district. I've had it in my mind for years that I want to teach high school history. I've mainly been subbing in middle school special education classes - meaning that these kids are lower skilled than the average student. 

I turned down a job today because I didn't feel confident enough to do it. I'm not an authoritative person. I've had a really hard time stepping in and getting kids to do their work. I know exactly what to say and I have a very professional monologue in my head. But I freeze. I can't say what I want to say. I think ""you don't belong here. These kids don't know you so you have no authority. They don't respect you. I bet the teacher thinks you're doing a terrible job. How can you be a teacher when you can't even tell these kids to focus and stop goofing off?"" It's awful. I have to force myself to speak up every time.

My boss is very bad at communicating, has his own ideas of how things should go and doesn’t accept anything that doesn’t match those, but his ideas change constantly and are very high expectations.

I’ve made a lot of progress with my anxiety since February. First month at my job I was terrified all the time, would get home and cry, had to do breathing exercises at the bathroom to get through the day without crying.

Yesterday my boss was out of office, wouldn’t answer my messages asking for approval to move forward (had a bunch of people waiting for this), and asked, without telling me, a coworker to intervene, who changed specs of my product without informing me.

I’ve been a mess. Couldn’t relax at any point during the evening, dreading my whole workday today, and having a lot of trouble focusing/not crying. Boss still won’t answer when I message him but is communicating with other coworkers. It’s important to mention that before this project I hadn’t gotten criticized before and people were happy with me.

I've had pretty bad anxiety for a little while now (undiagnosed because my parents are military so they have the ""suck it up mentality""). It's gotten worse as I've grown up and right now I think it's at its worst:

-I pick at my skin on my upper arms and they're all scarred over
-I pick at my nail beds until the hangnail is gone (it never is) (usually ends up as a bloody mess) 
-I zone out for a good amount of time, just sitting at running through scenarios of how I could fuck up/ why i shouldn't ask for help from my teachers/friends

Anyways, the reason it's gotten so bad is because I've recently moved to a new school in a really really small town, which naturally is very different than my old school that was in the city. This isnt the issue though, the issue is that my teachers HATE me drawing in class and drawing is my main coping mechanism that keeps my mind off the bad stuff.

 So now I've been left with the picking and everyday I leave school with bloody fingers. So much that I've even started to accept that it's a real problem. I'm struggling in my classes (chem specifically) because I'm to scared to ask my teacher for help since theres only like 7 people in that class, so theyd all see I dont get it, that would make me feel so stupid (I have friends I hold on a pedestal in that class so that just adds to it) 

I want to ask my mom to take me to counseling, maybe see if there is anything a professional can do to help me,  whether it be medication or therapy, I don't know, I just want to feel better 

The point of this post was to.. vent a little I guess? But also I was hoping to get some other people ideas on how I should ask my mom? I dont know, I know I'm overthinking it, but that's just how itll be. I was also hoping for advice on what to do to cope in the situation she says no and I'll have to deal with it on my own

1098,t3_dj0kj4,I'm not sure what to call this!,"Hi everyone. I've tried writing this post a few times and it always ends up too long, so I'll try and be brief.

For my entire life, I've always felt sort of anxious about everything, all the way up until I was in my early 20's. It was never enough to bother me, but I always felt out of place or unwelcome or like I didn't understand the rules about the world everyone else seemed to inherently know. I was too nervous to make eye contact with the lady behind the register at the grocery store - it wasn't debilitating anxiety, but it definitely was something!

I joined the Marine Corps two years ago, and I've loved every second of it. I got my butt handed to me in boot camp by Drill Instructors, who were leaders and mentors that saw what I was capable of and wouldn't accept anything less than my best. It was a very transformative experience for me, and after those three months of training, I feel like I'm in control of my life more than I was before. I'm less anxious, more confident, and I love talking to people! Gaining a little bit of healthy weight sure helped too - I feel confident in my body; a feeling I'd never had before. I did some time with the Marine Corps and I'm now currently in the Reserves and attending a university.

But there's one lingering issue from before my service - I can't bring myself to go out and try new things. It's very strange, and I can't put my finger on a reason why! I've made big decisions before - enlisting with the military definitely was a huge decision! But small decisions or small leaps-of-faith are so difficult in a way that I can't exactly describe.

At the grocery store, I consider grabbing some new ingredients and spices and experimenting, or learning a new meal to cook... and then I buy my normal stuff and leave.

On a boring day I consider driving to the local rock-climbing gym and testing my skills and maybe meeting some new people... and then I sit inside all day and do nothing.

It seems like outside of my little piece of the world, between my local gym and my classrooms in college and the library, I can't bring myself to do new things or meet new people! I'm in my early 20's and I don't enjoy how averse I am to going out and having new experiences. I don't think I've done anything aside from my usual college routine for the last year.

I'm wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom or a direction to point me in so that I can research my issue and make a plan for how to combat it. The only professionals I have access to in my area are school counselors - I visited one, and after I told her my grades were high she told me I didn't need her. (It seems like her job is to make sure I get out with good grades, which isn't my issue!)

1100,t3_divsj7,Cleaning and control related anxiety,"Hey guys! I've recently begun my final year of uni and in the last few weeks my anxiety feels like it's ramped up to maximum, and I've gotten really fixated on a few things, namely cleaning and being in ""control"" of everything. I'm finding it incredibly difficult to leave the house without cleaning the kitchen, and living with messy student housemates doesn't really help.. I feel like I'm constantly cleaning up after them to feel some semblance of control. Like I can't be in the kitchen without cleaning it because otherwise I just feel BAD and fixate on it until it's clean. 

I know this is probably a slippery slope to something more uncontrollable so I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone else struggles with this. I'm trying to learn that it's okay for there to be some mess, that a spotless kitchen isn't everything, but I can feel myself getting more worried about cleanliness and hygiene everytime I indulge in cleaning. But I also keep thinking that it's okay, because all I'm doing is cleaning which is fairly harmless and beneficial to everyone. I don't know how to think about it in the right way! Am I becoming too obsessive as a way to cope with stress and anxiety?

I think it's just this feeling of needing control. When I've cleaned the kitchen I've ""controlled"" my fear of uncleanliness and now I can cook in peace and go on with my day. But as soon as the kitchen's messy again the cycle begins anew. My housemates are getting annoyed with me nagging them all the time and I'm getting annoyed at myself for not being able to just leave it a bit messy and get on with my life.

While some of my fear is definitely to do with germs and hygiene, I feel that's more rational, because I want the food area to not be contaminated. But mostly it's aesthetic related, like moving things off surfaces and out of sight, and decluttering, which makes me get the most anxiety relief. I do it in my own room too, just declutter my space because it feels like I'm clearing out my stressy messy brain too. I hope this makes sense haha.

Does anyone have any similar issues or advice? I don't want this to overcome me. I've been in CBT before and it helped, but these issues are fairly new so I haven't spoken about it much before. Am I overreacting and this is normal behaviour? Or is this looking a bit iffy and maybe I should get some proper help?

My memory is so jumbled at the moment, I can't even begin to distinguish reality from not. Whenever I try to ground myself, I get extremely anxious and sometimes I have a panic attack. People apparently call out my name, and I rarely respond. I also often go through these short periods where I just stare off into space, not processing anything at all. When I get out of these weird states, I can't remember them happening until about an hour or less later. Sometimes I also find evidence of me doing things that I don't remember doing, such as poetry, and evidence that I've self-harmed, like cuts on my arm. Why is this happening to me",Anxiety
1106,t3_dizoru,DAE have poor affect display?,"*Affect displays are the verbal and non-verbal displays of emotion. These displays can be through facial expressions, gestures and body language, volume and tone of voice, laughing, crying, etc.*

I always have trouble expressing my emotions in a physical form, e.g. in my facial expressions. I might be perfectly content and happy, and someone will stop me to ask why I'm angry, or why I'm sad. I say that I'm not, and then they mention that I'm frowning, or I look like I'm about to cry.

It goes the same for when I'm actually upset or angry. I'll mention something to a friend like, ""oh I wasn't doing well yesterday, that's why xyz"", and they'll be like, ""really? I couldn't tell. You looked fine to me.""

I've also had my family get mad at me for ""taking things too seriously"" after I've made a sarcastic joke. When I say that I was being sarcastic, they fire back with, ""no you weren't, you were being passive-aggressive, I can see it on your face"". I get frustrated when this happens, so I end up actually being angry because they told me that I was angry when I wasn't.

I've always just learned to say, ""that's just the way I look"", or ""I have RBF"". I have dealt with this for years and I'm thinking it must have to do with my anxiety (which I have also had for years, coincidentally). I was sort of made to bottle up my feelings as a child because I had a hard time restraining my emotions. I was easily angered and excitable, very reactive to insults or jokes. Now I think it's messed up my expressions.

I don't have trouble feeling emotion. In fact, I would say that I feel emotion more than regular people thanks to the anxiety and depression. But my facial expressions and body language don't match how I'm actually feeling. I thought for a while that maybe I had mild autism, but I've done tests with psychologists before and I've had maybe one trait, but never enough for an official diagnosis.

So, DAE have this problem? DAE have mismatching facial expressions/body language and get accused of being angry/sad/anxious when they're fine?",Anxiety

Have been on medication for anxiety for about 6 years now. 

Had been on a consistent dose of Venlafaxine for 5 of those and coping extremely well, stable, confident, happy.

Just before last Christmas, hit with a WALL. Anxiety levels I haven’t felt since before medication. Had forgotten how intense and bad it could feel. Saw my doctor and increased my dosage. Felt better for a few weeks, then worse again. Saw my doctor, repeat. This cycle has gone on in the months since to the point where I’m now at max dosage of Venlafaxine AND a second medication, Wellbutrin. 

What is happening to me. I don’t understand why it would change so suddenly and so drastically. I’m also now seeing a therapist. 

One thing maybe worth mentioning is I tried shrooms for the first time, and two subsequent times in the months leading up to Christmas - would that be enough to affect me this much, for this long? Has anyone else suddenly stopped responding to medication?",Anxiety

He told me he really cares about me but needs to see improvement since it's not fair to him. Which of course I agree to.

1116,t3_diyabx,Anxious about getting a diagnosis,"Trigger Warning: 
panic attacks, trichotillomania

First off, I don’t have any kind of anxiety diagnosis and realise I need to see a doctor in order to get one - this post isn’t asking for a diagnosis but rather advice and support on how to approach my gp. Some stories as to if/how seeking help worked for you would be appreciated. 

I am also Scottish and have tried accessing therapy through the nhs website with no success, most recommended apps are also unavailable to me and therapists nearby are costly. I also believe at this time medication would be of more benefit to me and am under the impression anything that works must be prescribed to me not over-the-counter

I’m writing this after having another huge panic attack which has left me convinced I’ll make a doctors appointment, however I don’t trust myself to follow through in the morning so I’m posting in hope that responses will bring me to my senses.

I’ve had symptoms of anxiety since around age 11, where I suffered from constant hair pulling, leaving my hair patchy - this was a result of bullying in school which also led to stomach aches, migraines, and panic attacks. Long absences have been a trend in school and work for me ever since.

When I approached my doctor about this with my mother my anxiety symptoms were said to be effects of bullying and the stomachache was said to be period pains and puberty.

Since then, I have continued to experience symptoms of anxiety in worsening degrees, I think the lack of a real diagnosis or counselling put a bad taste in my mouth around doctors regarding mental health and I really doubt myself and feel like going would be a waste of a doctors valuable time. 

When I got my first job I left after 8 months and haven’t worked a real job since. I quit due to panic attacks every morning and stomach pains and in some cases diarrhoea and sickness on busier more stressful days. Around the time I left my work (which was around Christmas time, I left without even giving notice due to the severity of my fear; I feel awful about this.) I had a night similar to tonight where I promised myself I’d seek help, but nonetheless I didn’t follow through.

I’m currently at university and going through the process of starting work experience. An invitation for a phone interview brought on a massive panic attack, and although I have a stomachache, tightness in my chest, sweaty hands and feet, and feel like I’m full of adrenaline every day, this spike in anxiety around work will definitely hold me back as it did before and isn’t something I can work around without quitting and hiding like I’ve done in the past.

1122,t3_diuubd,Vent + Advice needed,"I have  been having a rough couple weeks with a lot of intrusive and existential thoughts and thought I would vent to get it off my chest, for example: 

* How am I going to cope when my mom / my husband (not even married yet) / my sister passes away
* How am I going to cope with aging
* What if I am alone when I am older, what if my kids abandon me (don't have any kids yet)
* What if I get sick and am not able to live a full life.

I had a panic attack three weeks ago that was a consequence of therapy and delving deep into trauma. We decided to take a step back after that because we realized I am alone in this city and don't have a strong support system. 

The anxiety right now is leaving me feeling a bit hopeless. Reddit and social media can be a double edged sword where I see thing that trigger these thoughts and make me thing what if that happens to me. For example I saw a post of suicidal ideation and that just triggered so many what if thoughts about what if I get so depressed and I get to that point. 

I know really these thoughts are manifesting from: 

* Homesickness, feeling lonely in the city I am currently in. Many times all I want is someone to just lay down with me and be there while we are doing our own things. My best friend from back home has been a saviour in she facetimes me everynight until I fall asleep. I try to get my roommate to sleep with me cause we are close but she is really busy and goes to sleep much later than me and wakes up much earlier. My other friend here is just really busy and he comes over sometimes, I bus with him so that is nice but I wish he would come over more. 
* Getting to the end of my degree, thinking about what I am going to do next. I know I am going to take a break after I finish my degree but after that I don't know what I want to do with my life - maybe policy analysis cause that is what I want to do now. I know I want to have a full life, have things to do on Halloween and thanksgiving, meet with friends and travel. That is what is keeping me going. 
* Trauma from when I was younger making me fear that I will never get into a good relationship. I have body and trust issues which I now I need to overcome but will probably work on when I am back home and have a better support system.

1123,t3_dik2u5,Does anyone else ever feel like a fraud because your anxiety is different to how anxiety is usually portrayed in media etc?,"I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder in February this year, I was put on Lexapro and I’ve been seeing a psychologist every six weeks. She think I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was a child, but I still have moments where I worry that I don’t actually have anxiety, because mine is so different to others experiences that I have heard about or seen in media. 

First of all I don’t have any social anxiety, which I feel is probably the most well known kind. I love socialising, meeting new people doesn’t faze me and I actually feel better when I am with other people and out and about. I love public speaking and it doesn’t scare me at all. This makes me feel like a fraud, because it’s so easy, surely I don’t have anxiety? If that makes sense?

Secondly, my anxiety is mainly focused on a few things: death (myself or my children dying), throwing up (emetophobia), and then a few other random phobias like flying, life like mannequins, confined spaces and bugs etc. These fears weigh on me considerably, but I feel like they are all so random, and not issues that you usually hear about in people with anxiety.  

I also don’t doubt myself daily, as in I don’t second guess all of my decisions, and I don’t hate myself or have low self worth. I feel like I hear about these in particular from friends who have anxiety all the time, and it’s just not an used or me. 

This is silly, but you know how there are lots of memes out there about what it’s like to have anxiety? I feel like I don’t relate to any of them. It really makes me doubt everything, like what if my psych is wrong? But she is the professional so I should trust her.

On top of that, I feel like I've been thrown back into being a teenager again being judged by these girls who just innately know how to be feminine and look fierce in a way I just never will. 

Every single time I get a hair cut, I come out with something conservative a stylist bullied me into because (I can only assume) she doesn't think I can carry off what I actually want. Like today I even asked directly and threw ideas back and forth with her and she still essentially just gave me a trim because she doesn't think what I want will look good. I was told my hair was too flat, too dry, too fine but there was also too much of it, too long but it wouldn't flatter me to go any shorter and that covering my forehead would be good but not this time - and the only solution was to buy these expensive products and get a treatment done... 

I got the treatment but managed to escape without the products. I don't know. I just wish going to a salon was this supportive experience where the hairdressers were there to listen to you and help as opposed to try an upsell and judge.

My boss the owner of the company is older in age and is semi retired (usually only works a few days a week). I’ve pretty much assumed all responsibility’s of the day to day operations. I’ve enjoyed working where I do over the years. I have great flexibility in my schedule that allows me to take off time when I want to be able to go on trips with friends, allow me and my girlfriend to just plan random things and if I need to leave a little early here or there then it’s no big deal.

My anxiety is literally keeping me from holding down jobs, and I just don't understand how an SSRI by itself is supposed to cut it.

What treatments have worked your severe GAD and/or social anxiety? What else should I consider trying? I am at a complete loss at this point. I don't think I will ever be a functional adult and it makes me want to give up.

Before it is suggested, CBT and other therapies aren't an option due to unemployment/insurance. For now, i need to look at medication options to get me to a place where I can finally explore therapy treatments.

TLDR: 20mg escitalopram (Lexapro) not cutting it for very debilitating GAD/social anxiety. Therapy not an option. Curious about additional medications to explore to supplement the Lexapro. Don't want to just keep stacking SSRIs and crossing my fingers. Looking for advice.

Thanks everyone.",Anxiety
1137,t3_dinsow,Anti-anxiety medication,"I'm 27, male, and I'm suffering from depression and anxiety for most of my life, and it really harms my life. I'm seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, and I'm treating my depression with Wellbutrin (Bupropion) 300 mg for the last 2 years after a not so good 1.5 year experience with Cipralex (Escitalopram), first 10 mg, then 20 mg - mainly because I felt it really numbed my emotions, shut down my sexual drive and didn't mesh so well for the ritalin I'm taking.

My anxiety is ever-present, and it's grounds me everytime I want to do something, be it clean my room, go to the supermarket, dare to talk to some customer service representative, study for school or advertising my business. Every day I'm having internal battles with myself, because doing anything scares the living lights out of me, and it's exhausting.

I'm sure most of you relate on some way or another, and some of you also have some experience with anti-anxiety medications. I'd be happy if you could share your experiences, be them positive, negative or both, how did it affect your life, and how did it mesh with other meds you were taking (mostly Ritalin and Bupropion). Anything you can share would be appreciated. Thank you and have a great day.",Anxiety

She has done many other things too through her life like stealing and just general having an awful attitude,and gets into sort of tantrums and will just storm off with the biggest bitch face ever on. She is also a serial liar, when I told my parents about everything that had went on with her work they said that she told them that she got fired because she was sick and obviously not the other parts.

1143,t3_diw8s6,Burnt out nervous system from too much stress and anxiety?,"Is this actually a thing? So I got off SSRIs about a year ago, and first 3 months was hard but I got a lot of my feelings back and stuff. I had weird symptoms and such... but I still had emotions and sexuality. During this time and the months following I had extreme anxiety, DPDR, and stress due to the withdrawal basically. I also had a lot of moments where I had extreme panic attacks beyond comprehension. After each of these panic attacks I would get way more numb (happened like 4 times). Anyway, is it possible the stress of withdrawal burnt out my nervous system completely?

I basically lost feelings, got anhedonia, sexual anhedonia, lack of sensation in genitals AND skin... feel kind of ""numb"" all over my body, yet I do not feel anxiety really.

When I feel anxious or dissociated I dont really feel that anxiety feeling, like the panic and stuff.. i just feel really uncomfortable and I don't know whats going on until im like, oh its panic/anxiety... 

I feel fatigued but it is like a mental barrier, when I push past it I kind of am fine, yet still sorta fatigued but its not like a real fatigue... feels different.

1147,t3_dipfje,5 pitfalls to avoid when recovering from anxiety,"Hey folks,I struggled with anxiety and panic attacks years ago.  I managed to fully recover and since, have been helping many others fully recover full time.  I wrote an article for my private Facebook group about the 5 pitfalls and figured, this would be helpful to others.  The people in my group are people who are focused on fully overcoming anxiety once and for all.  Hope you enjoy the post:

**Avoid these common pitfalls**

Recovering from anxiety is tricky, yet simple at the same time. While individuals who are struggling with anxiety think that their behaviors are harmless and benign, it is in fact, not just unproductive, but causing them to dig themselves into a deeper hole in the cycle.

I see this too often.

I was able to eventually avoid these pitfalls myself. I was very lucky, yes. However, I wasted a ton of time and energy making these same mistakes below.

If you see yourself doing ANY of these things…it’s important to take a serious look, and re-evaluate your plan of attack for recovering with anxiety.

**1. You’re on forums too much (yes that includes this one also):**

The internet in general provides a rich soil for misinformation to take hold to the unsuspecting observer. Too much conflicting information, woo-woo, loony toon theories, scare-mongering, and quacks with good intentions give you bad advice or uninformed guidance. It’s easy to abandon the right method and try to copy-paste someone else’s mildly-successful attempt at recovering. I call this *the shiny object syndrome* — and it plagues many anxiety sufferers. The truth is this. Recovery doesn’t lie behind a computer/phone screen.  It doesn’t come from watching a YouTube video, Facebook/reddit thread, or a google search. Recovery comes while living life. If you’re on forums too much, anxiety is too big a part of your life…and you need to minimize as soon as possible In fact, everyone who becomes my client eliminate all interactions or engagement on forums

.**2.  You’re still looking for tips for anxiety and panic attacks:**

I get this question all the time. “Hey, do you have any tips for recovering?” Listen very closely — tips don’t work. And if you think about it, tips are just a sophisticated way of making you stop feeling your feelings…which is the opposite of what you should be doing. It also plays into the narrative that lack of your recovery has been caused because you have been “missing the secret” or don’t know the “hidden quick fix cure.” To be honest, addressing the anxiety is not the hardest part of recovery…its breaking the bad habits that keeps anxiety alive. And tips don’t fix that. In fact, just *telling* people what to do is not enough. Think of losing weight and getting fit. It comes down to eating less and working out more. But we all know it’s not as easy as that, it takes guidance, structure, education, and patience…anxiety is no different.

**3. You are still trying to figure out the “root cause”:**

Whether you’re trying to figure out why you have excess adrenaline, why you’re still having brain fog, why your dp/dr is so strong, or what caused your first panic attack…the solution doesn’t require a root cause. This is a common impulse I see. Out of all the sufferers I’ve met (and I’ve met a lot), literally 99.9% of them didn’t need to figure out the root cause in order to recover. I get it, you may have had trauma. I understand…many people in this group have had trauma, many have not. “But my trauma is unique and intense.” Sure, but recognize trauma can be anything. Even getting lost as a child in a grocery store is traumatic. If you’re one of the .01% who has had trauma that needs to get addressed, address it fast and focus on recovery at the same time. Otherwise you’re just using your trauma as an excuse to convince yourself you are unique. Which brings me to my next point.

**4.  You have convinced yourself you are unique and unable to recover:**

This is partly anxiety’s fault. It has a great way of making you think you are unique and alone. Are there other people that have recovered? Sure…but you think you can’t.  Why?Because your symptoms are the worst ? Or you’ve had them the longest? Or you have another problem that stops you from recovery? Right? Does this sound like the internal dialogue in your mind? How would I know this? Because I not only thought this, but I have also heard this from *literally* every other client.  But I get it. Convincing yourself you are unique is understandable…but if you’ve been in this group for a while, you should know by now that you aren’t. On a subtle level, recognizing you’re not unique is a hit to your ego. This is because you’ve been struggling for so long, it’s easier to think there is an inherent flaw with you. When I was struggling, I was wishing there was something physically wrong, because I didn’t want the stigma of having anxiety. I’m so blessed it was just anxiety and nothing serious. Let go of the thought that you’re unique.

**5.  You’re unwilling to invest in getting this fixed:**

“WHAT?!?! Of course I am! I’ve bought essential oils, lavender, CBD, supplements, meditation, yoga, accupuncture, and tried meds but it didn’t work.” Initially while struggling, many of us spent a small fortune on getting anxiety fixed. We’d go online, search whatever fixes this, and buy the product from whichever company that “claim” to cure you; but when it doesn’t, you become disheartened and stop. We begin to realize the world is a cruel and money-hungry place that is willing to do anything to take money from the desperate . In the beginning, we all spent a small fortune... this is understandable…but once you learn that true recovery come from within, if you are still buying things like these -- you’re not someone serious about recovery, you’re a dabbler. And you can’t dabble into recovery. It takes work, focus, patience, and guidance.

Did I miss something? Probably… but these are the top 5 that come to me right away, and I thought this post was getting too long for it’s own good.

If you are someone dedicated to recovering and need some additional help, I'll post a link to the fb group in the comment below.  There are article, podcasts, videos specifically focused on helping you recover.

1148,t3_divs2t,My anxiety is taking over my life,"I apologize in advance for the gramatical mess your about to read.

Hi I'm really struggling with my anxiety the past few years...I left 2 jobs because I simply could not get out of bed and deal with the people there and all the pressures to perform and be perfect. They were both really good jobs on the outside looking in, good pay possible room to grow etc. I would just leave work every day feeling like shit like I'm a horrible worker and I can't do what they are asking me to do..so I quit both of my jobs. The first one I was there 2 years and dealing with an arrogant boss who basically sat us down and said I dont give 2 craps about any of you, your here to make money and make me money so no talking or messing around etc. Like literally killing the office spirit..that whole company was a mess to begin with making us force people into their contracts or charging them money my boss told us to, making them stay in their contract even though the contract said they could leave..a manager sexually harrasing some of the other girls. I just couldn't take it there anymore so I just decided to quit. Next job, they didn't train me and got mad that I wasnt learning anything, but they wouldn't really let me do anything because it was a medical office &amp; the girls were extremely catty and conniving..making things up to get me in trouble etc..always judging my personal life like vaping and other personal choices thats not their business. Anyways I thought I just ran into some bad luck with these jobs and everything would smooth over once I got in a steady stream of income again. I've been working since 16 in jr year so I've always had a strong work ethic.. but here I am in my room for the 3rd day in a row calling off my job I've had about 5/6 months after that tough time. Since my new job my anxiety was bad at first, always worried about getting fired over my mistakes or performance or my learning rate but it is manageable somewhat since I work in a factory and dont deal with people that much anymore and I can just stand at my station for hours at a time and take deep breaths and try to survive it. I had what seemed like a panic attack the entire day of sunday when I worked..i also got my monthly cycle and that always seems to make me lose control. Just constantly in a state of feeling like crap, feeling like i cant breathe and just highly irritable. After work on Sunday I was so drained that I called off work Monday to today.. I would wake up instantly in a state of panic for no reason at all. Just shoot my eyes open and heart racing already. I just want to lay in bed and not deal with any of it.. it seemed like I decided to call out before I even opened my eyes. This happened to me too when I quit my last 2 jobs like my subconscious was making the choices for me instead of listening to reason..like hey you might lose your job over this..but the other part of me is like who cares thats just another day I don't have to do anything and I can always find a new job. Then I spend all day feeling like crap that I made a bad choice and I'm putting myself through this again and its going to throw my whole routin off again..because when I call off one day I just never want to go back. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to start..I want to manage it all myself and not rely on medication to feel better, I want to be better as myself without a supplement...but its like almost every day I'm worrying about something like my heart skipped a beat am i going to die? A loud airplane flew above the house, is the plane going to crash? My boss looked at me funny does he hate me now? Things like that..I'll also visualize things too like if we drive under a bridge I imagine it crashing and me and the driver freaking out about to die, almost like ptsd but it didnt happen I just get sucked into it. I dont know but its taking over my life I cant go 1 day without freaking out over something. And i think I hide it pretty well because I think i come across as a pretty happy go lucky type of person..I'm sure they can tell im a little high strung but I feel like bosses, parents, family and friends will be like we all deal with stress just get used to it.

I have to constantly move my neck left, right, up and down every 5 minutes to relieve the tension.

On top of the neck pain I also have lots of clicking noises in my neck that sound flat out abnormal and are constant. 

I had an x-Ray recently and it showed my neck was fine. I might try get a MRI to rule out a “physical” cause, but at this stage my GP probably thinks I’m crazy. 

Could this pain be anxiety related? I was genuinely sure it was arthritis or some severe disc degeneration...

On top of that I also have these physical symptoms: 

- Acid reflux (makes me choke)
- Excessive saliva (makes it difficult to speak and makes my lips peel)
- vibrations and tremors in thighs
- Back pain
- Jaw clicking and pain

I prepared for it really well and applied for the job.

But also there is that annoying feeling that I made a fool of myself today because I was so happy during that feedback interview that I was kinda nervous and just smiled weirdly and asked dumb questions. At least I feel like I did.  
Also there is that fright that I will end up embarassing myself when I am working in that position and regret it.

I am 23 and will be younger than all the others team leaders (I think none of them is under 30) and also much much younger than a lot of the regular workers that I will then have to give instructions to.

Also I already know that some of the other employees will hate seeing me in that position (I don't give a fuck honestly lol but I am afraid that they will try to make this bad for me).  


I really think I can do this, I am clever enough and I now my stuff and also I get along with all the other team leaders but I am afraid that my social anxiety and lack of experience will ruin this for me.

Recently however I’ve started university, and am doing an overseas semester in Athens, which has been really great. It affirmed a lot of things for me: my trust in myself, my independence, and my belief that I had a handle on anxiety. Until issues with financial aid started.

I come from a low class family, and without getting into details, the process for me to get financial aid has been so painful and difficult. Today I got an email telling me I needed to pay for everything by November 1st. I’m in touch with advisors and have contacted everyone I could, taken all the steps I’m able to. I know I’ve done my part.

But the waiting. God, it’s just the waiting that absolutely kills me. I had a full blown panic attack in the shower just thinking about getting kicked out of school. It makes my stomach do flips, and that heart-wrenching feeling begins.

1165,t3_ditzpi,Help from those who've read The Untethered Soul.,"Hello, I've been really into mindfulness lately, from daily meditation to therapy to reading books and it's helped so much in understanding my anxiety.

So once I got my hands on The Untethered Soul after reading so many good reviews I was very excited. But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the voice in my head that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to say that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I think of literally anything, i think oh this is not me, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry is that also not by my choice? Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?

Hopefully you understand my dilemma I'm in. I really want to continue and read the whole book but it seems everytime I try to understand the who ""voice"" thing my anxiety starts to raise and I get confused.

I usually don't have issues to fall asleep, but I tend to wake up very early due to nightmares and generalized anxiety. I'm doing therapy and take no medications. On the last year I made a huge progress on my mental health and I started to feel better.

However the last weeks have been very draining and I have started to feel depressed and hopeless because my sleep deprivation is getting worse. My back hurts at all times and my mind can't stop overthinking everything. 

Yesterday I had trouble sleeping because I had a very bad dream about my mother. In the morning she told me the doctor found a spot in her lungs on her x-ray scan. So now I'm absolutely terrified about that as lung cancer runs in the family. I know we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet, but I can't stop worrying about it. I don't think the dream I had means anything, but the ""bad news"" only validated and worsened my anxiety.

I don't want my mother to die and I don't want to continue ruining my own health because I can't sleep enough. On top of that, I can't deal with daily tasks and have no motivation on doing anything.

I really wish I had something positive to share, but everything seems so dark right now. I forgot how to shut down my thoughts and I feel lost and hopeless.",Anxiety

My description: 
-I have long hair (think Keanu Reeves, but shorter
-Slightly rich lips
-High nose bridge
-Skinny (Not a surprise seeing how I’m only a teenager)

At first, I thought to myself before growing my hair:

“It’ll be fine, they’ll know you’re a guy because of you’re clothes.” I was wrong.

Every single time I go outside there’s always at least one or two people staring at me.

On a few occasions I would hear them talking about me when they think I’m not paying attention, or am not listening.

Most cases whenever I would walk pass someone, most of the time they would turn their heads towards me whenever we crossed paths.

The whole thing is sort of super-charging my anxiety, and it feels as though I’m being eaten from the inside out. I could cut my hair of course, but I’m super used to having long hair and would not like to go back using hair products (Pomade, Wax, etc.) to make it look good.

I guess I’m just asking for support on my side. Because I feel as though people never consider how I feel whenever they make comments about me whenever I’m in public.

1174,t3_diti9b,I think I have Anxiety,"TLDR: I think my diet is causing anxiety.

So in the last few months I have noticed that I have this feeling of dread for no reason at all. I have always felt a looming dread but it was occasionally or for a specific reason like upcoming exams. However, recently it has increased significant and multiple times a day. For example, I would being playing Sonic and all of a sudden I would be feel it hit me. I would carry on with the game hoping it would go away. Sadly it doesn't and eventually I will stop what I am doing because this feeling takes away the enjoyment. I also want to cry when i get this feeling and my heart seems to get faster. This feeling seems to be more in my heart and gut than my head if you know what I mean.

My life has not really changed apart from two things. The first is that I am in the process of applying for university though I am not necessarily worried about this since I have good grades. The second is that I have started going to the gym and dirty bulking (clean bulking was way to hard and costly) to increase fat and muscle. I have been following my routine pretty consistently and have seen good progress. My calories have increased by double in about 3 months. Could this be the cause?

I also believe I have a some depression (probably for a good 2 years) likely caused by family issues or genetics (my mum has it) which I have heard can lead to anxiety although if I have depression why has my anxiety gone through the roof in the last month. The depression has gotten a bit better recently too and I am not on any sort of meds a part from my eczema cream. I admit I do not know a lot about anxiety or mental health in general for that matter and likely have some other problem nonetheless I would like your advice and help please.",Anxiety

I have some sexual difficulties. Not to the point that it's really a problem, but it is really annoying. The worst problem is with the apathy. I have no motivation whatsoever to do anything. Some days are worst than others, but the majority of the time I have to kick my butt to do everything.

I spoke with my doctor about it after taking the medication for about 3 months. She told me to wait if the side effects would decreases. So now after 8 months taking citalopram, those side effects are still there and stronger than ever. 

I took an appointment with my doctor, but in the meantime, I was curious if some of you had the same problem? And if a kind of antidepressant could aleviated those side effects (particularly the apathy)?

On top of that, I truly love and miss these relatives and WANT to see them. They’re older and I rarely get to make this trip, who knows if they’ll be around next time? But the idea of sitting there trying to think of what to say puts knots in my stomach. We’re planning to spend 1 day driving to each relative and visit for a bit before moving on to the next one.

1182,t3_disxuj,Has anybody here had EKGs/stress tests?,"Hi reddit, 

For the last couple weeks I've been experiencing intermittent chest pain. I dont have it everyday, but when I do have it, exercise makes it worse. That seemed like a red flag, so I went to my dr. She noticed I have PACs (extra heartbeat) but said it's probably benign and sent me for a stress test/EKG. The cardiologist said the same thing...I have an extra beat pretty often but nothing to worry about, otherwise looks fine. 

Anxiety was suggested. I'm not embarrassed or reluctant to start a regime if that's really what it is, but did anybody else here start thinking they had some kind of heart issue and end up correctly diagnosed with anxiety? 

It has been a very stressful year for me and I had a traumatic childhood (no contact with my parents since I was 19 in 2012) so I wouldnt be surprised. But it seems strange to me that the chest pain happens intermittently, not all day and not every day. I've also noticed I get it when I'm relaxed as well. And there's times I'm stressed out that I DONT have it. 

I'm just very confused, open to all thoughts or comments. I know the answer is ""talk to a dr"" but after my results were normal I've essentially been dismissed. The cardiologist spent approximately 10 seconds with me, and my dr called after that to say 'great news,youre fine'",Anxiety

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypochondriac:**  *a person who is abnormally anxious about their health.* 

**Cardio phobia:**  *Cardiophobia is defined as an anxiety disorder of persons characterized by repeated complaints of chest pain, heart palpitations, and other somatic sensations accompanied by fears of having a heart attack and of dying. Persons with cardiophobia focus attention on their heart when experiencing stress and arousal, perceive its function in a phobic manner, and continue to believe that they suffer from an organic heart problem despite repeated negative medical tests. In order to reduce anxiety, they seek continuous reassurance, make excessive use of medical facilities, and avoid activities believed to elicit symptoms. The relationship of cardiophobia to illness phobia, health anxiety, and panic disorder is discussed. An integrative psychobiological model of cardiophobia is presented which includes previous learning conditions relating to experiences of separation and cardiac disease; deficient and inappropriate behavioural repertoires which constitute a psychological vulnerability for cardiophobic problems; negative life events, stressors, and conflicts in the person's present situation that trigger and contribute to the symptoms; current affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms and their stimulus properties; and genetic and acquired biological vulnerability factors. Finally, recommendations for the treatment of cardiophobia are derived from the model and areas of future research are outlined.* 

&amp;#x200B;

So a little back story to when it all started,  I was in the 8th grade in my science class I started getting heart palpitations and about passed out in class,   im not sure what caused this but I would worry that it would happen again.   Everyday I would worry about it so much once I got in my science class that I would make myself have panic attacks and would have to go to the nurses office daily, any other class I was in seemed to be OK just happened in that class because that is when it was first triggered.  Throughout the year it started getting worse and would start noticing myself panicking about it in other classes until finally one day it was all day long.  Few years and here I am,  but now it actually physically hurts me,  like make my chest hurt or my left shoulder heart (cardio phobia) .  After i finally told my parents I felt like a bunch of stress was relieved and it actually cured me for months.  4 months later and here I am going back to how I use to be, physically in pain and worrying about it and not sure what I should do.  Has anyone experienced anything like this before?  If you have what did you do to overcome it?  Even if you don't have an answer just support would be great,  its very tough for me.",Anxiety

When it started talking about the voice in my head that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to say that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I think of literally anything, i think oh this is not me, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot.

She's been incredibly good help and I help her in the exact same way. It's all good, then last night she said that she doesn't know how to help and she can't deal with me being happy one minute and sad the other and anxious the other etc. She understands it's worse for me but it affects her a lot too as we see each other so much. I completely understand this but she asked me to leave her house last night because of it. She doesn't know how to help or prevent it. I dunno what to do. Am I supposed to give her a heads up before i see her with how I am and predict how I'll be later? cos I can't do that as it changes so much. I love her and I don't want to leave her but I just don't know what to do or say to her after that. I'm on medication and have been for a long time, I have regular therapy, I exercise and my diets good.. Any ideas? Thanks.

1206,t3_dim6q1,A lot has been going on lately and I’m not sure how to handle it,"(TW: Mention Su*cide)

Background information:

Jan-May of 2018 was easily one of my worst periods as far as anxiety went. I was in a dead end relationship and didn’t really know what I wanted to do in school. I finally went and saw a psychiatrist, where he diagnosed me with GAD and Health Anxiety. After trial and error through various doses and medication, I finally stabilized months later and was doing so well!

This past August, I took a real adult trip by myself to San Francisco where I got to visit a friend from kindergarten and then flew south and explored a lot of Los Angeles and the beaches. Just by myself. It was the first sense of ACTUAL independence that I’ve ever felt. It was incredibly liberating. I told myself that I wanted to move there. I still do, and I know I will.

Everything was fine until September came.  I had to quit my second job without notice due to toxic/difficult circumstances surround work. I’m glad I’m out of there, but I now need another job (which has not been easy to find.) A week after I quit that job, my cat almost died from a bladder blockage. Thankfully, I caught it early enough to where he made a full recovery without any internal damage. However, That situation set me back from my goal of moving because I had some money in my savings that I now slowly have to drain to pay for it. Though it’s a lot of money, he’s still here with me today and sleeping by my side right now.. and that’s all I could ever ask for. ❤️

However, another week passes and I find out that one of my old friends shot himself. This wasn’t someone I kept in touch with easily because we had a very odd friendship. Regardless, I’m still trying to process all of that and work through the grieving process. I’ve never known anyone on a personal level that’s died, let alone killed themselves. I miss you so much, pal. I’ll always wonder what you were doing in your last moments. I wonder if you were scared. I feel sad that because he made a mistake, he felt like his entire life had to end. This situation has raised a lot of inner questions regarding the existential and what comes after. It absolutely terrifies me, especially since I’m so afraid to die. 

Basically, I feel like I’m back to where I started a year and a half ago. My health anxiety is slowly creeping back and every tiny symptom is freaking me out. I constantly think I might be dying. I’ve been having to take small doses (0.5 mg ≤) of Ativan just to stop the thoughts and constant somatic symptoms. I’m finding it very difficult to do simple, everyday things: general hygiene, laundry, wake up without going straight back to bed. I sometimes forget to take my meds, but I’ve been getting better about it. Sleeping has been my biggest coping mechanism the past 6 weeks. It’s easier than being awake and anxious all of the time.  I’ll sleep 7-8 hours but still fall back asleep for a few hours mid-day. 

I’m very SLOWLY trying to back into a normal routine. Tonight I did all of my skincare and did some laundry, which I’m proud of. However, I just started some online classes and I’m having trouble finding the motivation to complete anything so far. The stress of everything has just been taking a major toll on my entire mind, body and soul. I’m really trying my hardest with certain things and I feel like I can’t catch a break. 💔 

TLDR; Anxiety about my sense of existentialism is crippling my life.

Edit: I just want to add that I feel like I’ve been so shitty to my friends lately, too. They know what I’m going through.. but I don’t feel “all there” when we have a conversation, especially if it’s over the phone. I don’t feel very present at moments and I think it’s just my brain trying to zone out and protect itself.",Anxiety

1225,t3_diodsf,Anxiety or not?,"Did I do something wrong?

I think it will take someone who understands mental health to understand my logic. But, here goes.

I have OCD and issues with men. I avoid any interaction with men. If they look at me, I walk in the opposite direction. If they talk to me, I’m rude in an attempt to push away any unwanted attention. When I talk to men, I have intrusive thoughts such as: you like him, you want attention, he finds you attractive. I don’t like these thoughts, they make me feel uncomfortable. I have a boyfriend. So, in order to avoid these thoughts, i avoid interactions with men. 

I know, when I drink I can be friendly. Nothing over the top, but when I’m tipsy, I am able to speak to men without these thoughts bothering me. I still have the thoughts such as: “you like this attention”, “you like him”, but when I’m drunk I’m able to push these thoughts away, out of my mind, dismiss them and carry on the conversation. My obsessive thoughts don’t bother me when I’m drunk. 

On Saturday, I went to a house party. As soon as I got there, I had intrusive thoughts about my friends boyfriend. I was happy to be at the party so chose to ignore them but didn’t engage in any conversation. As I drank more, my friends and I began conversing with my friends boyfriend and as I began to speak I started to feel self conscious. My thoughts were telling me that I wanted this guy to speak to me and I liked the attention. Instead of avoiding, I carried on talking. The conversation was about travelling and getting careers and where we were from and for the most part, his girlfriend was there too. (If she was not there, someone else was). There was no flirting, nothing sexual going on. I kept having these thoughts: “should I say bye when he leaves?”, “should I talk to him again?” I felt almost, frozen. If I was sober, I would have left this conversation ago. I know I wasn’t doing anything wrong. So why do I feel like I am guilty of something?

1227,t3_dio6lm,I've been having out-of-control panic attacks for the last week that have caused extreme memory loss and are preventing me from doing things I need to do. My next psych appt is on the 31st. Am I justified in going to an urgent care?,"For some background, I'm being weaned off of a high dose of lithium that I've been on for years.  I was discharged from the hospital about three weeks ago and it was a traumatic experience (they're...  known for that...  :/) and they were treating me for Bipolar disorder instead of depression.  My new psych that I've seen twice said that that diagnosis (also made by the same hospital several years ago during my first stay) is incorrect and that I certainly have major depression--hence weaning off of the lithium.

I'm pretty sure that the med change is making things much worse for me than they will be once my meds are straightened out again.  I called my new psych last week and got put on the waiting list for if an appointment slot opens before my pre-scheduled appointment on October 31st.  No luck yet, and these panic attacks are becoming unbearable.  I'm forgetting where I am, who the people around me are, getting lost everywhere I go, having around 30 panic attacks a day (not counting the ones in my sleep), and I just can't follow through with most obligations now because of it.  Everyone who has been around me, even briefly, can tell something is seriously wrong.

I was wondering if there is anything an urgent care can do to help me get through the next two weeks until my appointment with my psychiatrist?  This is mentally and physically exhausting and is shaking up my family.  Not to mention that I'm also supposed to be going to job interviews!!!  My life has come to a screeching halt again.

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for some years now, and recently it has become much harder to bear. Ive started going to these free therapy sessions at my university and that’s going alright, but they are short and there is a lot of rehashing, and I feel that is bothering me. 
This week violent protests broke out in my city which my partner is part of and yesterday I got the news that a friend of my (not super close) passed away. All of this is making it much worse than it has been. 

I’ve always felt that I could cope but these last few months, and this week especially, have been a breaking point. Im not studying anymore or working on my writing, and instead lay in bed eating junk food, watching Netflix, and drinking a lot to cope. 

When  im with my partner it all goes away, but the moment I say goodbye, everything pops up again with a vengeance. 
I just feel like I can’t really deal with it anymore and am afraid that I’ll be lost in depression soon. I know this is a bad way of thinking, but I’m truly struggling with all of this to point of breaking.

anyway, this friend i confide in is busy almost all the time between sports and hanging out with his girlfriend. i’m always scared to message him because i don’t want to interrupt anything or be a bother, but i’ve really come to see him as a brother and trust him a lot in the last couple weeks and i enjoy talking to him and helping each other get through life. i get kind of sad when i see him hanging out with his girlfriend even though i love them as a couple and they’re both some of my closest friends because i know it means the person i rely on the most is going to be busy for a few hours and i won’t have anyone to talk to.

To preface this, I'd already had a really stressful day at university. I had loads of deadlines and I missed an important feedback session because I got lost and couldn't find the right room (which was also really embarrassing...). Then on my way to work my dad phoned me to tell me he'd had to call an ambulance for my mum that morning and she was in hospital. He told me not to worry and she was okay now, but I turned up to work freaking out.

Because of all this, I was really distracted and off my game at work. I decided to just tell my manager what had happened so he didn't think I was acting weird or being rubbish at my job. I didn't expect to get emotional at all - I hadn't had a chance to tell anyone about what had happened to my mum and I thought I'd also worry less if I got it off my chest - but halfway through my story I was suddenly about to burst into tears.

It was soooo awkward.... He seemed very confused/surprised that I was telling him this and suddenly getting really upset. I was equally as confused/surprised. He started asking me all these questions but I could feel my bottom lip wobbling and knew if I spoke I'd just start crying. There were also still customers around at this point.

I think I recovered pretty quickly and did feel waaaay less stressed after I told him. He was also pretty nice about it and said I could take any phone-calls I needed and offered to make me tea.

1234,t3_dinqgy,Anxiety about being a single 30 year old man,"To cut a long story short, my fiancee and I split about 18 months ago. Was the most heartbreaking time of my life and I firmly planted myself in self destruct mode. 

After about two/three months of self destruction I started to see a therapist and work through some of my issues about the relationship and just general anxieties I've had for years. I knew I'd always been plagued by these issues, but I never knew to what extent it had seriously impacted my life. Couple of examples below:

• Prevented me from saying no

• constant people pleasing

• not viewing myself as a proper adult

• attaching myself to relationships all the time because I thought that's what I needed

• I allowed my ex to mentally abuse me, not just her but the one before her as well. Some of the things I've unpacked during therapy have made me see how toxic and abusive the relationship was. I almost feel bad believing this though because I still don't necessarily see those things as toxic/abusive actions, and feel if I mention them to people they'll think I'm so stupid. Anyway, I guess they were because my self esteem and confidence is non-existent.

&amp;#x200B;

I've now had approximately 75 hours of therapy and while I can see quite a big difference in certain areas of my life (trying to be more of an adult, saying no more, communicating better, trying not to people please all the time, sticking to arrangements, not letting my house be unclean, cooking more, walking my dog a lot more, etc etc), my anxiety still feels very, very bad - sometimes I feel anxious all the time. I think it's got a lot to do with the fact that since June (I know that may not seem long, but to me that's quite a thing), I've had very little interest from women. I've not been on any dating sites or anything, but even a bit of flirting or whatever when I'm out hasn't really seemed to occur. As I'm sure you're all aware, someone that suffers with anxiety needs constant approval from people about their self worth. While I'm not actively seeking female companionship at the moment so I can work through my issues, and get to a stage where I don't give a shit about anyones approval, the odd bit of approval and compliments etc give me such a boost. Being 30, I feel like I'm running out of time - irrational I know, but it's the way my mind works. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the time, my ex meant the entire world to me - she was my reason for being, so taking that away had a huge impact on my mental health, and my self esteem. While many confident people would simply look at the end of a relationship as a bump in life's road, I look at it like it's the end of my life - my chance to ever be with someone again has now been and gone, and when I think about being with someone again, I just can't picture it, especially with my current state of anxiety. I'm sure my ex is dating someone, or dating around and that's not my concern - she's entitled to do whatever she wants, but by God this feeling of jealousy that she's doing better than me and this overwhelming fear I have that I'm not wanted is horrible. This idea I have that because I'm single and not dating or even have any women interested makes me less of an adult, a child. Being with my ex made me feel like I was a proper adult. We owned a home, we bought a dog, we were getting married - that's gone now.

I saw a psychiatrist 3 weeks ago after feeling overwhelmed at normal tasks, anxious and irritable. I've had a lot of life events recently including family deaths, buying a house and I'm getting married next year. I was coping but realised it wasn't normal to feel like this and needed support. 

I've got a session of CBT booked for next week and I've been taking sertraline for 2 weeks but I've never felt worse! I've got minor chest pain, I feel nauseous, worried, I've been signed off from work by my GP due to the side effects.

Lots of people say to stick with it and that it'll get better but I'm so close to throwing the towel in and stopping the medication - I feel so guilty that I'm at home trying to do ""nice"" things and not enjoying them - I've never felt more stressed or worthless.

1243,t3_di4prq,I am so tired of overthinking.,"I feel like every single hour of my life my mind is filled with ""why did I do that"" events. Those events are always about when I let myself go too far, where I talked too much, broke down, in completely unreasonable circumstances. I have a lot of basic life stress, and a lot of bad/traumatic events in my life, but I don't let anybody know about that. Now in the couple of events that I did tell people that, and primarily the events where I brought out suicidalness, I can't stop thinking about, and it makes every thing that I talked about that brings me stress even more stressful. They didn't ask for me to say that, they didn't ask for me to break down. Ugh, I just hate this. Like why do I feel even worse, feel like they're constantly judging me now, and thinking I need help. I don't want people to help me, I'm perfectly fine. But now that they know, they're going to want to talk to me, they're going to want to be ""soft"" around me, and try not to ""trigger"" me. Just why did I ever tell them in the first place? I'm completely overthinking, but it seems like so much like a rational overthinking (if that makes any sense). I want people to just be them around me, I don't want people to think about me while I'm around them. It's a great big circle, of all of my stressors, and all of the few people knowing of the stressors. I've never had such bad anxiety about my stresses, until I let one person know.

1252,t3_dimj74,I need help to find an ESA,"I've done some research and found that an Emotional Support Animal would be very beneficial to me whether it be a cat or dog (I know there are other animals besides cats and dogs that can be trained to be an ESA, but I've only ever been around cats and dogs, and I've owned more than one cat in the past so I'm more experienced in that area), but I've run into a few problems:

1) I need to be properly diagnosed by a therapist for anxiety and depression, but where I live it can be a huge hassle to go through to even get a therapist and I'm also too socially anxious to talk to people in authority such as a therapist.
1a) This is a problem because according to my research, I need to have an ESA letter written by a therapist which would enable me to have an ESA. I read that I can fill out a form or something if I don't have access to a therapist, but the website didn't say if it was for New Zealand or for America only (but this would be a huge help). 
2) From what I've researched, there isn't a lot of support/help for ESA'S in my country (New Zealand). I found a New Zealand website for therapy dogs which includes emotional support dogs, but there wasn't a dog listed for that specific type of training.
3) I found out about emotional support cats, but I wasn't able to find any information about them at all. Emotional support cats would be more beneficial to me as well, as they're more affordable and easier to take care of and they don't always require a lot of exercise.
4) The cost. My parents are separated, and one side has barely enough money to live in a decent house, and the other is able to pay for what they need and have a bit of money left over but not enough for an animal. If I was to get an animal, whether it be an ESA or not, I would most likely have to help pay with my pocket money. 

If possible, I don't know whether I'd get one now/soon or in the future, but I know that having one would benefit me greatly. I avoid going into stores or crowded places, and sometimes school can get overwhelming. I've never had a panic attack, but I've been in situations where I've frozen out of fear (I don't know if that counts as a panic attack or not...?) and just had high blood pressure because I start to panic or stress in normal environments. It would be helpful to take one to school, but I understand why it wouldn't be allowed (plus I would probably get a lot of people trying to pat the animal, and it may cause a distraction).

Ever since I was around 16-18 years old I would get these single ""thump"" heartbeats right in the center of my chest. It is a quick sharp pain, but nothing beyond that. It usually happens 2-3 times a month. I was checked out by a doctor when I was younger and they said I had a heart murmur, they did an ECG and echocardiogram. They found I have slight valve regurgitation (not sure which one), but told me to enjoy my life and take everything in moderation (I followed this mostly, just not with food...).

I have had one hard skipped beat each day for the past two days. These things drive me crazy and ruin my day completely. I end up googling what it is over and over obsessively for hours. It sounds like these are most likely benign PVCs or PACs. Last month I also went to my doctor and they did a 12 lead ECG and told me I was fine. I asked if I needed to do another echocardiogram or stress test, but they said it wasn't necessary because I am so young.

1255,t3_dikaon,Anxiety everyday.,"Idk if this is what you would call anxiety. But when I get nervous or feel anxious I throw up and my stomach starts to hurt. Most people’s stomach just hurt and they have to go to the bathroom. 

When I get nervous it’s usually something new in my life. Like new job, starting school, anything new basically. My previous job I would throw up everyday before work and at work before I actually started my job. After a while I quit because I got used to it and the people. 

Fast forward to today, I throw up horribly every morning(just started school, college) and I’ve been throwing up since I was younger, not like this though. I honestly don’t want to even wake up because it’s so bad. I wake up an hour and a half before I have to be at school(I work after school) and I throw up and go to the bathroom for like the first 35-40 minutes. It’s terrible. It’s just because I’m super nervous and whatnot. Before I started school I would throw up only once before work almost every morning. I’m stressed at my job a lot so I’m thinking that’s why.  And the funny thing is, when I am in school after like the first 5-10 minutes, I’m fine. I always say “why was I even throwing up” or whatever. But everyday it’s the same thing. I don’t think it’s a habit either, because I was able to stop previously for a while and it randomly started back up again. 

My family members think I should go to the doctor. I have before recently and they did blood work and asked the usual questions and the blood work came back perfect. The reason I’m also avoiding the doc is because I don’t want them to give me a pill. I don’t want to rely on or be stuck on a pill for the rest of my life. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m having trouble gaining weight because of this issue. I am in shape, but I would like to gain more weight. 

Last thing I’ll add, I cannot tell myself that I won’t throw up. A lot of people tell me it’s in my head etc etc. I can’t tell myself no. Although I do not try to initiate the throw up, I just feel it in my stomach and throat, and I can’t stop it once I get that feeling.

I'm hoping it's not something that would cost me my job but I'm terrified anyway. They'd know it was me that didn't pull the door to lock it. I'm just hoping someone else did it before they left or if they didn't that I won't get shouted at too much.

I do not lie about my age, general location, really change my personality, etc., etc. – all I ever change is the name I use. The problems start whenever I put out anything that I consider less than perfect and/or start interacting with a wider community. I always get trapped in the line of thinking that I'm just forcing stuff on people or they're just indulging me as so to not upset me, which just escalates to me really wanting another 'fresh start' and trying to get everything right.

1272,t3_di5q70,I can't stop the intrusive thoughts in my head and compulsive guilt trips. Please help.,"A bit of context: I've been suffering with a constant feeling of guilt and anxiety for as long as I can remember. As a kid it was more sporadic it would express itself as anxiety attacks where i'd feel like the worst person in the world for something insignificant I had done in the past (take something home from school that wasn't mine, cheated on a test, said something mean to someone in the playground). I'm 24 now and since I was at least 18 it has been a constant sense of guilt, culpability and anxiety that I cannot shake, not even for a second no matter how much fun I'm having, I never feel at peace with myself.

I often get violent episodes where flashbacks of shameful things I have done in the past rush to my brain and repeat themselves for hours and sometimes days on end. I want this post to focus on the intrusive thoughts I'm having right now rather than the history of my anxiety.

Please help me. It's been 48 hours. I was lying in bed on Sunday morning and a memory flashed in my head out of absolutely nowhere. I remembered a picture in my yearbook where we were at a conference with my class taking a group photo, 7 years ago. There was a serious photo, and a ""fun"" photo. While everyone is making silly faces I turn around and hug my male friend and give him a kiss on the cheek. It looks really inappropriate and it certainly WAS inappropriate. It looks worse than it sounds. Our school principal is standing behind me, and I'm pretty sure the dude I'm hugging had a girlfriend at the time. Now that book is sitting on people's shelves and I'll be remembered as the school slut forever. Why couldn't I just be like the others and make a silly face? Why did I have to behave like that? Why did I think that would be a fun memory to look back on ?

For the past 48 hours I've felt sick to my stomach, hardly eaten, have had a voice constantly telling me ""you're a whore! You're a slut! Everyone knows and that's why you never had meaningful relationships with people in school! That's why no one liked you!"" On repeat. Again and again. I was definitely promiscuous in my final years in school, I didn't notice the pattern at the time but I tended to go after other girls' boyfriends. After being the model child till 15 I snapped one day and started whoring out. I'm so ashamed that now due to a number of other factors as well (several types of horrible anti depressants that killed my libido, a failed long-term relationship I feel responsible for and a series of fucked up experiences with boys) I hate sex. I'm terrified of it. I think I don't deserve it and I don't want it anymore.

I hate myself.

I've reached out to my psychoanalyst, I have an appointment in 2 days. I haven't seen her in a year. My anxiety is constant, I'm never not anxious and I very often get these intrusive thoughts and flashbacks that make me feel so ashamed of myself. It's so bad that even when I'm in the shower or trying to fall asleep I need to put a show on in the back ground so I can concentrate on someone else's voice than the horrid sound of my own voice in my head constantly telling me you're a bad person! you're a slut! you're an embarrassment! people were right not to like you!

She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me in my entire life. She has expressed her love for me in so many ways as I have done the same for her. But, I have anxiety. And I’m constantly worrying she’s gonna just lose interest in me. That would devastate me in a way I can’t put into words. There’s no reason for me to worry about that, but I do. And I’ve read some threads where people have said that in a relationship if you’re insecure about things like that, it usually leads to the relationship ending. Which makes my anxiety worse. I’ve already talked to her about this and she’s reassured me that it won’t happen and I do trust her. Anxiety is just a bitch and I just wanna hear yalls opinion.

1278,t3_diesma,The anxiety won today,"I know I'm dumb when I'm stressed. So I keep notes. On the calendar where and when I need to be, before leaving I see note ""are you sure you have everything to keep you alive before coming back?"" which makes me rethink the contents of my bag in case if there would be an emergency (I'm usually short of having pajamas and toothbrush from being able to just admit myself for the hospital for the long term, if needed).

I was going to get my assessment at the Institute od Psychiatry and Neurology today. I was a nervous wreck for the past week about it, imposter syndrom hitting *hard*, my hands shaking to the point where it became dangerous for me to wash the dishes (still did it, cause fuck you, anxiety), heart beating hard each time I saw the calendar, dizziness, weak stomach, whole shebang.

And I forgot my papers. It's an hour drive from my home, I couldn't just go back and get them. I panicked. I literally panicked. *I fucked up, I fucked up*, my brain sang hysterically. All these tries to get the referral, all the waiting for the appointment, and I *forgot my fucking papers.* I wanted to die, to vanish, to hide and never come out, to cry, but all I could do is sit there, while the nurse was trying to establish whether the doctor can see me at all.

I contacted my health worker and called myself names and explained the situation and swore profusely some more and even she couldn't get through to me. ""It's not your fault, it happens, the anxiety is making you perceive it out of proportion, but it's okay, it's *okay"".* It's my anxiety. My fault.

I forgot my fucking papers.

I got another appointment, on Thursday. So nice of them to get it so soon this time. I'm not worth it. I'm not worth the gas I've spent to get there and back. I'm not worth the time. I'm not worth the effort.

I can't even remember to take my fucking papers with me.

The only task I have to do is get the mail from the mail box and I’ve been pretty anxious about it lately. I kept checking the window to make sure nobody was outside when I went out to get it. I keep getting anxious when I leave my house for anything but it’s even more amplified when I leave my house alone. I really want to be able to go outside and even try exercising or going on walks but I have so much anxiety about it that I try to avoid it entirely. When I’m out with my family or boyfriend and child i don’t last very long, I usually want to go home a curl up into a ball again.

1280,t3_difret,Strategies with generalised anxiety disorder,"Years ago I suffered from emetophobia (fear of vomiting, sounds ridiculous, was not that funny). I made a lot of therapy and exposure training which was so effective (and freaking hard) that it eventually actually disappeared.

Some years I felt wonderful, having new freedom and yeah.

Had some troubles in my life as well last three years and somehow felt it was a problem somewhere and three months ago, it kicked in badly. I have no fear to vomit anymore, I fear I die now. From a heartattack, from pulmonary embolism, aids, cancer, aidscancer etc.
I have those weird scenes in my head over and over again and I see myself dying.
I am oversensitive to everything I feel in my body and everything I feel is a sign that I'm going to die now, in a couple minutes, tomorrow.
You can guess the state I'm in: everything hurts in my body, the whole day, which makes me anxious, which leads to more hurts, which makes me anxious etc. and everything is triggering me.

When I had emetophobia I learned, that anxiety is a curve, so it's there and will disappear again and with exposure (habituation) it'll grow smaller.
One strategy was: Not thinking ""I won't have to vomit"" but thinking ""Even if I have to, I won't die"" and this helped so much to learn, not to fear it anymore.
I also had safe-spaces, where I felt good and could relax.

Now my strategies don't work anymore, I can't say ""even if I die, I won't die"", I can't learn to not fear it anymore.
And I have no safe-spaces anymore, I can't relax.

Does anyone of you feel the same or also overcame it? 
How can I start to accept the idea that I will die? Is it a solution, to start thinking, that dying isn't that horrible? What safe-spaces do you have? 
I feel like I can't find peace, not even for a moment. How do you find peace? How do. you reduce triggers? 

I tried pregabaline, didn't help, I tried cbd, didn't help, I read books about the topic, didn't help, tried to change lifestyle, didn't work (because I couldn't change anything, failure), I even go to therapy, went worse anyways.

1284,t3_difgai,Dating a man with anxiety,"My boyfriend (29M) is the most caring and wonderful man I have ever come across. However, when his anxiety hits or he gets depressed he can’t seem to get out of his head. 

I feel useless (23F). I know he needs to help himself and I can’t save him but I want to be supportive. I want to be supportive but honestly I’m drained. Drained of being so repetitive or trying to uplift him but it doesn’t seem to work. He’s so mean to himself. His sleep patterns are shit and lately he’s been having a lot of panic attacks. 

I don’t know how to help. 

Lately, all he wants to do is stay in and cuddle which I love but I don’t want to do that every single week. We don’t go on dates but that also has to do with our busy schedule. I try to push him to get out of bed or do something, anything but it’s easier said then done I know. I just don’t want to seem like I’m nagging him. 

He’s constantly asking me if I want to be in this relationship and asks me if I love him probably 10+ times a day. I am someone who is very independent and busy and well all of this feels overwhelming. I reassure him I do love him because well I do. I try to be there whenever he needs me. I remind him of all his great qualities. Yet all of my efforts don’t seem to be helping. I’m trying to help him and support him through the dark days but I’m not sure it’s working. 

Today he texted me and said he doesn’t like who he is in this relationship. It threw me off and I asked him what that meant and well he just doesn’t like showing how bad his anxiety gets and he thinks he’s a burden. He’s constantly telling me how I deserve better and he always wants to push me away. It’s becoming an every day thing of him asking me why I want to be with him. And asking me if I really want to be with him. And I feel shitty saying this but I’m human and it’s exhausting. I love him but I need advice. 

I just want to see him get better. I don’t want to make him change. I just want him to grow and get better. I’m not sure he wants to. Or I’m sure he does but his anxiety really holds him back. 

Because of his anxiety I find myself not being able to talk about my day or my feelings because I have bad days too but I have to keep all of the bad to myself and only show him happy me so that it’s not both of us going through it. 

He has abandonment issues and has never had anyone take care of him and support him though his mental illness. Parents got divorced when he was young and his father was an addict. Mom was all over the place and not there for him.

He’s expressed that it’s hard for him to accept my love because he’s felt unloved for so many years. I don’t think he wants to break up. I just think he’s having a hard time letting me in and allowing someone besides himself see this side of him. He just needs reassurance that I will be patient and that I won’t want to leave.

This isn’t me making any assumptions. He’s communicated all of this with me. He never was good at talking about his feelings since me. I talk a lot and love communication so I have gotten him to do more of it because I know I couldn’t stay if I didn’t know what was on his mind and he’s made the effort to open up and communicate because he knows i would walk away if there was no communication.

Not sure what to do. 

I’d really like some advice from men who have anxiety and are in a relationship. And women who are in a relationship with a man that has anxiety. 
I just want some insight or any advice at all on how I can be of help to my partner and be of help to myself so that I don’t feel so exhausted.

Then a lot of really weird things happened that I don’t know how to really explain properly so I’ll just post the notes I took about it after it happened because it was so unnerving to me.

-felt like I was falling asleep but wasn’t tired 

-time felt like it was moving super fast but also super slow

-had basically no thoughts just sort of cloudy traces of thoughts 

-occasionally heard what was being said but mostly it was like a Charlie Brown wa wa wa

-tried to get myself back to reality by pinching/scratching myself but it only worked very temporarily before I sank back into it. 

-I think my eyes were open the whole time bu to can’t remember, I felt like they were closed but I’m unsure

-my hands were shaking and it was hard to write anything

-I only came out of it when I was given I specific thing to do (we ended up doing an activity with refraction gradings)

-I felt fine afterwards, I thought maybe it was because I was tired but I wasn’t tired after that or before that.

Growing up my symptoms never really went truly went away, I just got this overwhelming feeling about different things I couldn't control but tried hard to do. These things took over my life, from the clothes I wore, haircuts I got, showers I took in a day, the way I walked, the way I talked and things I said.

She still believes she is owed respect simply for “being my mother” and especially because she did more than just make sure I was fed, clothed, and sheltered.

1296,t3_dijhhd,My anxiety.,"My anxiety is high. It has been for as long as i can remember. My first memories of it go back to when i was a young kid, staring at the ceiling trying my best to sleep, having a panic attack because i knew i was supposed to be asleep. Everyone would be asleep and here i was awake all night. I don’t know what it was but being alone with my thoughts even at that age kept me up for hours until i was too tired to think, feel much or it was time for school. Being around people makes me feel so weak and tired. I never had a stable foundation so everywhere i went i was alone. Socializing makes me feel sick, i feel like i hate people. I see no good in people or myself. Even thinking and writing this makes me feel tired. I’ve started to have panic attacks again, it’s like i lose breath and i try getting my breathe on track but it makes it so much worse so i just have to deal with it. I don’t believe in meds because i know that i get to dependent on outlets instead of dealing with the problem. I’ve just started to get my eating back on track but still feels like a chore to take bites. I feel so alone. I feel it won’t ever get better.

1298,t3_dijex5,I think I'm gonna try medication,"I've been struggling with anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, I used to think I was sick all the time. I used to constantly miss school because I just felt terrible. Eventually, I learned it was anxiety.

I eat very healthy, sleep a good amount, have very little life stressors, meditate daily, go to therapy, and exercise regularly. These things all really help manage my symptoms, but everyday that's what I feel like I'm doing: managing. Everyday it's trying to keep everything under control rather than actually living and enjoying my life.

I don't really struggle with depression, but anxiety just keeps coming up. I'm not desparate, I'm just tired. I'm tired of thinking anxiety is my fault and tired of just thinking I need to get things right to just ""get over it"". And I'm so tired of panic attacks and focusing on my anxiety every moment of every day. 

I really think my brain just doesn't work right. I have an overactive amygdala and it's been that way since childhood. And there's nothing wrong with using chemistry to adjust for that. I'm not weak. I've tried so hard. And it's time to realize I have a very real physical illness.

I'm kind of scared because messing with my mind is something I don't want to take lightly. My doctor has been really encouraging and supportive of my choice not to start and reassures me that the most common side effect is no side effects. But, I still hear all these horror stories online.

My doctor wants me to try Zoloft, but I have an appointment tomorrow to potentially discuss Mirtazapine instead. My anxiety primarily manifests as nausea and kills my appetite and sleep. Mirtazapine's two most common side effects are increased appetite and sedation, which would hopefully help.

This post is mainly to vent and get my thoughts out because it's a big decision for me, but I'd also be curious about hearing people's success stories with medication. It would hopefully bring me reassurance.

I know that I truly have to reach out to a psychiatrist now so I can get some medication from day to day.  

Cause the thing is—I love my life and the future, but I am cripplingly afraid of it.

I’m just curious about the process of getting prescribed meds and going to a psychiatrist to get long term meds?",Anxiety
1318,t3_dii07r,Xanax is the only thing that has truly helped me,"Okay so I've had severe anxiety since I was around 7, then at 12 developed depression alongside it (hormones? due to anxiety? not sure). I am now in my mid-20's, and I have tried numerous antidepressants throughout my life. They have helped the anxiety somewhat, but not the depression, and they make me feel numb. Also I have developed severe anger issues, especially with family, who does love me but I hold a grudge for every little wrongdoing or BIG wrongdoing (like parents constantly fighting) that they have done constantly, and obsess over those thoughts constantly. It used to be a lot worse when I was in my late teens-20's : Family and I were in a super worse position than now and I would cry many nights and not sleep, have constant panic attacks. Every little thing that goes wrong triggers me and still does. I feel so much rage and irritation all the time. I have only done a few physical things (like pushing a family member when I got mad) but nothign to the extreme but I have thought about it constantly. Sometimes (well, more like occassionally) I am ok with them but one little wrong thing makes me unbelievably angry and I can't stop thinking about what they did that make me angry and it's all their fault that I'm this fucked. It is similar with my boyfriend. I have told him I thought about breaking up with him because he says one thing that is ""triggering."" I have not actually done so, when I was in a worse position a couple of years ago I would ask for small ""breaks"" but they only lasted like a day or 2. I remember when he felt sad at me and said that he wanted to go home, and he was sleeping next to me but my heart was racing and I panicked and cried all night and barely slept. As I've gotten old I've gotten triggered by so many ""little""  and what others would consider trivial things but to me they seem like the most awful things ever and it makes me so anxious I want to kill myself and hold grudges and makes my life seem awful. I also have had constant, racing thoughts since I was younger. I was always diagnosed with ""OCD tendencies"" as well as my depression, but honestly I feel like it's just OCD. When I was younger I used to have believe in God and would have to repeat the same phrases in my head in order to not anger God (also my family is not religious, I just did this myself). Now I am atheist but I am still always nervous if I simply SAY something, that something bad will happen to me (like jinxing/karma). This is CONSTANT. Like I am even too afraid to say I will graduate university, because I feel like something will prevent me from graduating if I say that with confidence. This is also because I have lived in a volatile/constantly changing environment for several years.

Anyway, I just weaned off of lexapro and since I weaned off of it anxiety came back full force. I have chronic sinusitis and have been getting a lot of sleepless nights due to stimulant medication to alleviate sinus issues. Last night I took sudafed and had a complete mental breakdown: I was crying all night, my heart was racing, and my racing thoughts would not dissipate. I wasn't able to sleep until 8am (8 hours after I tried sleeping) and I slept for 3 hours. I'm also addicted/obsessed to the internet and it just makes it SO MUCH WORSE.

I have taken klonopin on and off since I was a teen, and it was good at first and it still works but not as well as xanax. I only began taking xanax this year or so. It's been several months until I've taken it until today. The most I have taken it was .5-1.0 mg a day when I had finals last semester. I  try not to take it daily but it's the only thing that can help me sleep. I was first prescribed .5 mg but then moved up to 1.0 mg because the .5 was no longer working as well (dangerous I know). I do not currently have a psychiatrist, and my PCP prescribes me xanax, although he is extremely hesitant to do so (which is understandable). I am scared of getting addicted and getting Alzheimer's from Xanax. But no other medication I have taken has worked as well, and has calmed me down. I'm still a bit anxious, even after taking 1.0 mg tonight, but I don't know what else to do. I will not be able to sleep without it.",Anxiety

***May be a bit gross for some people I apologize in advance!*** I remember that I was reading in a group of 4 after lunch and my bowels began to just activate hard. I remember hearing my heartbeat and profusely sweating along with heavy breathing because the thought of possibly clogging the toilet, taking too long, holding up the line, or people smelling it from outside was so overwhelming.  
I debated with myself until my body couldn't hold it in anymore and before I could decide it was too late. The kids in my group started to make faces of disgust asking around if they smelled anything weird.
That is when it seemed like that was the first time anxiety had impacted me. Fast forward to 8th grade I began to vomit whenever I became anxious. I ended up going to a specialist and they diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder. They wanted to prescribe me medication and counseling but my mom declined and refused. Instead I got over-the-counter heartburn medicine to keep me from vomiting so much. 
Explaining this story to the specialist, she concluded that my anxiety was in fact hereditary.

Me (M26) my SO(gf) (F25) Length of relationship: 4 months

Hey everyone,

Please refer back to the link above if you'd like more context. But for a quick run down of that post - My GF recently admitted that she didn't love me anymore, only to take it all back.

It's been a month since, however I feel different. I'm not sure how to put it into words. The small bits are that I feel scared, a bit doubtful, nervous, and confused.

I am happy that we can confess our love for each other again and she did explain that in that moment she felt completely lost in emotion. I have tried very much to understand her pain and place myself into her shoes. I cant help but feel traumatized from the sudden shock of that event. Now something that has been bugging me recently is that we have been discussing marriage. I agree that a future sounds amazing but I almost felt pressured when she mentioned that she wanted it sooner than later.

I felt an array of emotions, mostly because to me, marriage is this huge event in your life and I personally would like to go in without any doubts at all. I personally want to feel what I think will be an overwhelming need to want to be with that person forever. I just don't feel that way right now. She's stating that she loves me enough to get married now - but I'm just not getting that from her. I did express that to her however it was met with immediate backlash. This reaction consisted of her feeling that I wasn't being logical.

One thing that has made me feel ""odd"" (not really sure how to describe the feeling) is how much she has asked me to change. Without any hesitation, if she wants me to party and socialize more - I do it. If she wants me to accept that she's friends with past lovers - I suck it up and accept it. If she wants me to travel more for her and with her and make more time - I do it. All without hesitation. I asked her why once. Why is it that I'm the only one that has changed? I always thought a relationship was built around either no one changing or both parties compromising. But this has felt more like a demand and supply. I feel genuinely hurt when I think about it. I feel like although I haven't found my identity, I've been molded into someone that's not me.

She's not willing to change for me the way I am for her. I don't want to be without her either. This internal conflict is eating away at me. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, I don't know how to label it all anymore. Or how to move forward. I've tried it all, changing my habits, seeing a therapist (Still seeing), taking medication. There doesn't seem to be anything outside of time as a solution.

I was informed by a close friend, a blunt friend that I tend to do whatever it takes to try and make a relationship work, even if it means I'm causing myself harm. I find a connection and build off of that with my hopes and dreams. All which blinds be to the real negatives of the relationship. My friend informed me that I shouldn't have to feel this way in any relationship. The need to change, feeling as if you're never...good enough. It's not healthy and that there will be someone out there that loves me for me. Just me.

I feel conflicted because I feel that my SO does love me for the little nuisances of my personality and my friend just doesn't understand that. I also do agree with my friend, that love should feel effortless.

At this point I'm ranting and venting but I'm curious to what anyone else has to say. Thank you.

Taking silent treatment as an example. Toxic right? But I don't think it's that uncommon. I haven't personally met someone who has experienced it, but it doesn't feel like something that would be so rare.

1356,t3_diejtw,Crippling presentation anxiety,"This is a personal problem that my family members don't even know about.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined the workforce right after my graduation.

I am now at a place in my career where I need to start giving more presentations in front of handful of people.

However, I have a crippling anxiety when it comes down to presentation.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I never really had any issues performing in front of an audience. 

In middle school, I used to do theaters and I performed in front of hundreds of people -- I was totally cool with that.

However, in high school, I had an experience in my English class where while I was reading out loud, I suddenly became breathless and my heart was beating so fast... I could barely speak. I finished my paragraph sounding like a dying toad.

Ever since then, I became terrified of performing in front of people.

In college, I dropped classes that required presentations because of this fear, and I am afraid this will really hold me back in my career development.

&amp;#x200B;

Small talks and conversations are fine, but when there are more than a couple of people staring at me while I speak... I feel like I am going to die because I can't breathe and my heart is about to burst from overworking (talking in front of strangers makes my symptoms worse). 

It's funny because after 10 minutes of experiencing the symptoms, I feel fine...

A lot of people are surprised when they learn about this part of me because they tell me I am so well-spoken.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to tackle this problem. 

Do you think taking propranolol  will help me to acclimate to the environment when I am presenting?

1360,t3_di4xm5,I can't control being easily irritated and I can't stop overthinking.,"I have Asperger's syndrome along with anxiety disorder for a good number of years. I have been fighting for years to get the appropriate help and support to ease the stress and tension but sadly the NHS here in the UK doesn't fund for CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and counselling. It is all done through private organizations and are very expensive, especially on the income that I am on.

One example of me being easily annoyed was when I was at the cinema to watch the joker film, one girl was kicking my seat and another guy sat 2 seats down coughing loudly, this was heightening my anxiety and stress levels as I wanted to watch the film with no distractions thus ruining my cinema experience. I always have to wear noise cancelling headphones when I go out in public as I cannot stand loud noises such as screaming kids, people coughing and just noisy people in general. Without this tool, I would not be able to cope through my day to day struggles.

My easily uncontrolled emotions seem to be getting worse due to family and work related issues and I am stuck finding a solution. I even went as far as going to my local MP for help as there was no structure out there for me which is very frustrating and yet his responses are very slow and arrogant (typical politicians). I am so sick of being tossed around to charities that cannot help me with my struggles and yet they are solely focused on their public image. 

I also find that mental health discrimination is completely ignored as I get heavily bullied for my social difficulties and my panic attacks. I once complained to HR about a colleague at work who took the absolute piss outta me saying nasty things laughing 'Ooh he's having a heart attack, quick do cpr haha' and yet they did nothing but give that heartless prick a slap on the wrists. My overthinking is the worst thing out of my anxiety, I cry most nights as I have this feeling that the world is against me and nobody understands my emotional struggles. 

My own mother refuses to accept that I have social difficulties and even called me a 'freak' which is the most hurtful thing I have been called. All I want is for people to understand what I go through on a regular basis and I honestly wish there was more help and support out there for people like me to have the same rights as everyone and not to be ridiculed by society.",Anxiety

I don't know where to start looking for help and I guess thats why I'm here. I don't think I've had a history of anxiety before, although I have had depression in the past.

I've been having issues receiving messages, phone calls, and mail, even for mundane things. 

If I get a text from my mom, I'm afraid to look at it; what if its bad news? What if I forgot I was supposed to visit her today? If I accidentally preview the text, i am then afraid to open the message to respond since I waited so long to respond in the first place; it makes me feel like a terrible daughter.

With mail, I'm scared of bills. I know ignoring them doesnt make them go away but I am so scared of opening mail. Even typing this out was hard. I'm pretty sure I can pay my medical bills, but what if there is something outrageously expensive in there?

The longer I wait, the more I want to ignore it since i feel guilty for ignoring it in the first place. Now throughout my day I feel so stressed at things I'm not getting done for seemingly no reason.

One thing I recently feel like I've gotten in control of is cleaning. Its kept my mind clearer and I feel less stressed when I clean. But i think I may be using that as a way to ignore other things i need to be doing. Even things I enjoy, like art. I told a friend I would do giftart for him and now I'm afraid to grab a pen to draw anything at all, and I'm afraid to talk to him because I'm letting him down.

I guess these are issues that have always been with me, now that I'm writing this out, but it's gotten way worse lately. The only person I do not feel this anxiety with is my boyfriend. He is fully willing to help me, but Im not sure how to enlist his help. If I get him to help me open my mail, isnt that encouraging me to continue ignoring my problems?

I guess I want to know where to start... What are coping mechanisms I can practice? What can I do to feel better?

Growing up, I played soccer and swam at a highly competitive level and always brought that level of competition into my training. Whenever I go to a yoga class, I cannot help but have that same competitive mentality. I FULLY understand yoga is NOT competitive and truly a “self” practice but if there are other people in the room, I will want to compete with them. The issue is, I am EXTREMELY inflexible physically and don’t have the strength I use to have when I was younger. This leads to frustration and anxiety in class, thus I never go back.

My first ever car was good for 3 years, then conveniently a few months after I lost my day job it decided to have a fun issue where it would literally cut out while I was driving and wouldn’t restart. That was terrifying in and of itself. Then I ended up spending the $2,000 I had left on my $5,000 credit card in order to get it fixed and my insomnia got worse as I stressed how I was going to pay it all back. I took it to a mechanic and 2 auto electricians but despite them believing they had fixed it, it kept happening. But I just gave up as I was out of money so I sold it to a car wreckers. 

With only my meagre night job I spent 3 years paying off my debt and 1 year rebuilding my emergency savings. All without a car. I was in a reasonably good place mentally and financially when my sister offered to sell me her old car. Even though I was worried it would happen again I jumped on the chance as she took good care of her car and she had just had it serviced and put on new tyres. 

But now all my emergency savings are gone to pay her and insurance, etc and even though I’ve only had it 3 months I’ve already had car problems. I’m just that lucky. The battery died the other week ($215) and recently it’s rumbling a lot while idling and cutting out and of course I’m going to have to take it to a mechanic.

I’m just so stressed about all the money I’ve spent and potentially will spend and Im beyond terrified of it dying on me like my old car. I hate that I regret buying it and I wish I had my money back and I didn’t have this constant financial burden weighing me down.

1386,t3_dibzxl,Drinking too much coffee leads to endless anxiety attack...,"So, wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else or my body is seriously messed up. Last week, I had a very long Thursday with work events, school, and then working my second job. I got a couple hours of sleep but had to be at work early on Friday. So I downed 6 cups worth of coffee at home...my office has a coffee shop downstairs, so of course I hit it up several times throughout the day. Like I drank probably gallons of coffee... I didn't get much to eat for lunch...so by 4pm, my stomach was literally in knots. 

I was sweating a lot, shaking, and ended up throwing up a few times from nausea. I knew I had clearly overdone it on the caffeine...and thought I could just drink a bunch of water, get some real food in me, and I would be fine. 

Well...I got home and attempted to eat dinner. I have this weird anxiety when I eat anyway, I'm like terrified I'm not gonna chew my food enough and I'm gonna choke...then I start watching my husband when he eats, afraid he is going to choke and I'm gonna watch him die. It's an irrational thought that goes through my mind anytime I eat....but coupled with the caffeine still raging through my body...it was unbearable. 

I had an hours long anxiety attack - went and stood outside in the cold rain just trying to breathe. Thought I was gonna die....the usual. I haven't actually had a physical anxiety attack like that in awhile, but normally I can convince myself I am not dying and calm down in under an hour. This WOULD NOT STOP. My husband forced me to come inside so I wouldn't freeze, but I hung out by an open window for hours trying to breathe. I eventually fell asleep/passed out from exhaustion. 

This was days ago...and I still feel very ""on edge"". Like I said, I haven't had a physical anxiety attack in awhile but now I feel like I'm about to go into one all day long.

I'm now a 22 year old and it's just starting to spiral out of control and I can't ""just stop"" anymore. I am over thinking everything I say, how I stand, how I move, how I talk and I can't for the life of me seem to stop over thinking all of it. I now have panic attacks when I order food from places I have been thousands of times, when I meet new people I can't make myself talk because I am worried it will be held against me or they will hate me so I would rather they not have a reason to hate me than give them a small possibility to like me. I have lost all of my friends that I have had for years because I always think I am boring them and they are just being nice because they feel bad for me. I just don't know what to do or how to control it. I've tried 3 different therapists and they have all told me that they will teach me how to cope and that I don't need meds but they just let me talk their ear off for an hour and don't give me any advice and I just don't know how much longer I can keep dealing with this.",Anxiety
1388,t3_dibw8x,"Really low chance of having certain disease, yet I can only think about it","If you suffer from hypochondria, please spare yourself from additional anxiety and skip to the next thread.

So, last night I was eating out with my bf. After we left the restaurant, we decided to take a stroll along the streets of the Old City's center, when I encountered a stray cat (who are super common here in Bucharest). Me, being an absolute idiot, wanted to pet her and she ran away from me, hiding behind a coffee shop's table. I guess my parents never thought me not to harass animals, especially wild ones, since my dumbass extended her hand in a last attempt to pet her. I didn't. She did. Actually, she scratched me. I guess the scratch was well deserved, but she kept meowing and acting really defensive so that made me question her behaviour.

Today, around evening, I saw her again. She was still quite jumpy, but seemed to act normal around other cats. She didn't try to attack me this time, instead she would start running if you approached her. Guess she was just a scared little kitten.

Still, is there any chance she might have been rabid? Can I get rabies?

My wound was superficial, she left a 1 cm mark across my finger, which was pretty shallow and didn't bleed for too long (guess it closed in a few minutes, can't remeber exactly cause I was freaking out). 

I did not go to a hospital because there has been at least a case here of a man dying because the virus in the shot was still active. Also, I can't find any reported cases of rabies among cats or dogs during this year or past year in Bucharest. So I guess I have the same risks no matter what I do.

Also, the cat also looked pretty good, she had shiny fur and didn't bear any marks of violence.

Still, I can't stop thinking about this. I've spent more than 2 hours looking for this cat today and observing her behaviour. I'm reading all the news from the past 20 years about rabies in Romania and I've googled all the statistics I can find. My chances are almos null, yet I can't help myself but feel extremely anxious about it. How can I manage this? Should I just call animal services and tell them to test the damn cat or wait and hope for the best?

1390,t3_dibij2,Depersonalisation?,"So I often feel very anxious when I'm in public; specifically about how other people are perceiving me e.g. my walking, and often end up hyper-focusing on certain elements of my movements, which results in me spacing out and feeling like I'm on autopilot. It's almost like I'm daydreaming, except I'm not thinking about anything and my mind is blank. This normally manifests itself when I am out in public e.g.  walking past turnings I meant to take; or even  sometimes at home when I forget where I put things that I was using 10 seconds ago, or  being unsure whether I have done things e.g. whether or not I already shampooed my hair in the shower.

I seem to oscillate between these two states: either becoming hyper-self-conscious of myself, and going on autopilot mode where I withdraw into my mind and almost feel like I'm watching the world from within myself, if that makes sense. I've spoken about this a bit with my therapist, but she never explicitly said whether I was dissociating/depersonalising.

1397,t3_di1ykw,It’s been years...,"I’ve struggled with anxiety ever since I can remember. It first manifested in elementary school. I always had such a difficult time going &amp; it gave my mom such hell. I would get so incredibly overwhelmed to where I would cry &amp; worry all night about hav to get up &amp; go the next day. After getting in trouble for truancy and being sent to a juvenile detention center, I was soon pulled out &amp; “homeschooled” (which realistically was me doing nothing).

Around age 20, I broke down. I was miserable, I couldn’t go in stores, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t do anything. I felt like such a nuisance to everyone around me &amp; opted for medication. I finally got to feeling better &amp; ended up taking a placement test to get my GED. My last actual completed grade was grade 6 but when the results of the placement test came back, I had scored advanced in each section. This put me in a position to skip the mandatory class time &amp; I passed the actual test on my first attempt.

I applied to college &amp; things were going so unbelievably well for me. I was in the top percentage in nearly every class &amp; even arranged a donation event with my school for veterans. During this time I was also working full time in home-health. I enjoyed my job but the upper management was terrible &amp; I’d even go as far to say I was harassed. One of the ladies would always pick me out specifically &amp; pick on me in front of the other employees. I eventually got burnt out and quit that job after a year due to panic attacks becoming a regular occurrence. I ended up taking a break from school as well.

I got a job in a grocery store. It was a simple job, but I was excited. I liked my coworkers &amp; despite being moved to front deli &amp; having to socialize with customers, I was still handling it. I ended up working nearly every day until close. I’d have older men come in later at night &amp; make sexual comments or comments that just weren’t appropriate. Seeing that I was the only employee back in this area at the time, there was no one to take my place. After this became a regular occurrence it just took a toll on me. I told my manager &amp; begged her to move me but she ended up just giving me another job on top of that. I found myself in a position with the original job that was emotionally exhausting me due to a tonne of socialization during the day with harassment at night &amp; another responsibility to go on top of that. I ended up with worse panic attacks than ever &amp; just stop showing up for work. 


I’ve been unemployed for about 7 months now. My anxiety has skyrocketed &amp; I have difficulty doing things like going to the store &amp; driving again. I know I have to get a job &amp; go back to school but I’m absolutely terrified of being put in a situation where I’m so overwhelmed that I can’t function properly like I was before.

I took Zoloft at first and it made me feel better but I had an extreme weight gain.  Psychiatrists have told me it doesn’t affect your metabolism, it only makes you more hungry, but I in fact felt less hunger.  I stopped Zoloft after taking it from October to around March, and the increase of dosage from 25 to 50 really kickstarted the worker gain.  the weight would not stop no matter what.  The second I got off, I slowly but surely shed the weight.

I then began taking Lexapro, and my psychiatrist prescribed a medication to lessen my hunger, which I didn’t know it did at the time I thought it helps with metabolism.  I gained 20 pounds but at a slower rate, but very evident.  My endo said it does indeed slow your metabolism down.  So I’ve been off of anything ever since this summer.

1408,t3_di2j9z,Am I descending into Psychosis/Schizophrenia?,"Hello Everyone,

For the past few months I have been worried about developing Schizophrenia.  It started when I thought I was having smell hallucinations back in March and then I started reading so much about Schizophrenia. I am not hearing any voices externally, nor am I experiencing any delusions or negative symptoms. 

What has been bothering me and why I really haven't been able to let go of this anxiety is being afraid of ""Voices in my head"". Ever since I read about voices in the head and internal auditory hallucinations, my brain went into overdrive. I would start making connections about situations where a schizophrenic would hear a voice and then my mind would make up the voice of what a schizophrenic voice would say. I do have quite an intense inner voice, which developed from my habit of talking to myself as a coping mechanism (I like to speak my thoughts out loud, and I am an only child). I have these thought like voices since like April, and they ranged from negative thoughts like ""You're worthless"" to command like thoughts like ""Push the cartwheel"", and they only happen when my mind makes the connection. I have had this april and have been able to manage a full time job and social committments, along with a 6 week summer course to complete my degree requirements.

I was getting better, and was almost not worried about Schizophrenia again. However, I work in SaaS Sales, and naturally I ended up getting stressed as sales can be a stressful job. Because of this schizophrenia anxiety, I have now very sensitive to stressful situations, as I believe any stressful situation can trigger the onset of schizophrenia. I started worrying about the voices in my head again. Legit, I didn't get anything for like 90% of the time, until I made a connection. However I would say this weekend, I just felt down for some reason though today I am feeling better and just negative of myself. I don't really feel worthless, but I kept feeling down and thinking things like What if I am a loser, What if I am worthless, and because I was worried about Schizophrenia, I was worried that this was a sign. I also felt depressed for a moment and then later that night, on Saturday, I had a bad panic attack where I was worrying about everything.

Today was when I started getting these terrible intrusive thoughts, all in my head. I have also been talking with this girl, and it has been going well, except recently where I overreacted to a seen message, but she has been replying to my messages but taking longer to reply to them (a couple of hours), which I am guessing due to midterms and friend gatherings. However, my brain makes a connection to schizophrenia and then I am getting these intrusive thoughts like ""She doesn;t like you"", ""She doesn't love you"" things like that. Later as I am thinking about something, my brain goes back to this schizophrenic auditory hallucination video that I exposed myself to:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vvU-Ajwbok&amp;t=105s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vvU-Ajwbok&amp;t=105s) . 

I can remember these voices through my memory, and some of them were just repeating in my head over and over. They stopped and then I thought about it, and then it repeats. Sometimes, I will be typing on reddit, I think about the voices and then I get a thought that goes like ""You're worthless"". I recognize that it is coming my mind, that my brain is making up these voices and they are not real.

I have seen five mental health professionals about this fear and all have said you don't have schizophrenia nor am I in prodome. I went through two psych evals who diagnosed me with anxiety and not schizophrenia. I even work with a therapist who has a specialization in psychosis and saw me last Thursday who said he didnt see any signs of schizophrenia or prodome, and he works with me on exposure therapies. Heck two weeks ago I tried to emulate a schizophrenic and failed miserably. However with these intrusive thoughts, I am worried I am descending into psychosis and schizophrenia.

I'm scared my stomach will act up, get very nervous and therefore my stomach does act up. 

Dinners, holidays freak me out the most because I won't know where I'm going to eat, if I'm going to be able to leave etc. As a coping mechanism I take medications beforehand or take them with me everywhere, sometimes even extra clothes (without having needed them ever) and always know where the toilets are. 

At the moment I basically feel nervous 24/7, the only thing that does not freak me out is when I have no plans and just stay at home reading.

1425,t3_di7inm,"A brief summary of my last 2 years. Please I need advice. Anxiety, sexuality, and depression","Hello everyone, the last two years of my life have been by far the most challenging. My mental health journey began in 2017 during my junior year of college. When I first went to college I was extremely eager and excited to experience new things. After a few months of being at college I decided to experiment with drugs. I had smoked   a little pot before attending college. But my junior year was when I legitimately tried smoking pot. I had an absolutely horrible experience getting high. I actually needed up having to go to the hospital because the pot sent me into super ventricular tachycardia. The next month following this experience is when things got bad. I had a massive panic attack one night while laying in bed. This panic attack made me go into a state of depersonalization and federalizations for over a year and a half (sometimes I still feel weird). During this year and half and still currently I worry that I am loosing my mind. I have developed a major fear of schizophrenia and psychosis. Also during this time I began to question my religion. I really began to examine what it was that I had been taught throughout my whole life. I was raised southern Baptist for 21 years. I started no believing in my faith anymore. I also became (and am still) very sexually confused. I have always wondered if I am gay. A brief backstory: Growing up people would always ask if I was gay. This question made my heart sink and I would always say no. In middle school is when I really began to feel like I had an attraction towards the same sex. During puberty, I would think about other guys. In high school I would also think about other guys. However, I was interested in a girl. I am not sure if this interest was sexual or emotional. So this being said I really began to think about my sexual orientation during this time when everything was spiraling during my life. I told my very conservative and religious parents I thought I could be gay. They weren’t having it all. My parents took me to a local hospital for an emergency mental evaluation. The doctor said their was nothing wrong with me and that he was sorry I had to deal with such ignorant parents. Me being confused about my sexual orientation has become an obsession. It’s like I cannot admit to myself that I could be gay or am gay. This has also caused a massive divide between my parents and I. I now fear that I am asexual because I am not sure if I feel any attraction. This past weekend I secretly went on a date with a guy and had a really good time. However, when I returned home to my family I was filled with sadness. I ended up breaking down in front of them and saying I was still confused about my orientation and they said they would never support me being gay. Can someone please tell me what they think is going on in my life or give an me some kind of advice. I am genuine worried about my sanity.",Anxiety

1427,t3_di2esf,I feel like medication has messed with my life enough.,"I was prescribed risperidone within a 10 minute consult at a psychiatric hospital three years ago, they set me up with someone to see after I was released. But my prescriber refused to look me in the eye, acknowledge my questions, she filled out the same template every time for years and despite ordering tests so she had suggestions to offer, she had no input. She “forgot” to formally give me my official diagnosis for a year and a half of asking for it. It was exactly what the psychiatric hospital had diagnosed me with. No input no changes. She never picked up her phone, my refills constantly ran out and we had to go get three at a time from the pharmacy until she had the decency to have her assistant call back. My mother had trouble finding a new one for two years/ and or she didn’t care enough to find one. I relayed my concerns about my medication nearly every visit until I gave up. I had tons of side effects I learned to live with. The worst being that it threw my period off balance. It ranges from 28 days to around 60, my pms lasts from 28 days until I get my period. I developed fibrocystic breast disease. I’m wondering if the risperidone threw off my hormone levels or something. On top of that, I noticed no change with my levels of anxiety. When I finally got a new prescriber she was horrified at my treatment and immediately finalized my diagnosis. After three years. She then switched me to 30mg of duloxotine. It’s okay, but again, I don’t notice any effects of taking the medication, until I have side effects. It’s only been two or three months on the new medication and I’ve had one period, which took 43 days to arrive, I’m late again, but I’m not sure how long it will take to even out. If I don’t take the duloxotine I’m nauseas, obsessive compulsive to the point I scratch at my face until it bleeds, I have an extremely dry mouth no matter how much I drink, and I get flushed and I sweat no matter the temperature. I have to take it every morning at 7 before I leave for school, waking up every morning to take it isn’t practical, and I often sleep through my alarms on the weekends. I just wish I didn’t have to take anything. All it does is negatively impact me. I’m tired of experimenting, hoping to try and find something that impacts me at all. It has almost been four years and I’m done. I want to be off of it. I just have no idea what to do.",Anxiety
1428,t3_di14nq,A game that calms anxiety attacks,"TL:DR is at bottom.

I suffer from extreme anxiety that I take medication for but when life gets stressful -as it often does- the medication works less effectively. 

As a result I tend to get panic attacks thoughout the day but mostly when I go to bed. Throughout the day for the most part I can keep my mind busy because I work full time and go to school at night. 

But going to bed and trying to relax my mind drifts and I start to spiral into a panic attack as my thoughts get more and more out of control. 

I found a sort of solution that could work for others as it works for me most of the time. When I feel this way I often play an app called Altos Odyssey. 
In very rare cases I have to take my emergency medicine but most times this app helps. 

It helps because it has a beautiful landscape with changing colors that keep your attention. Along with the relaxing music is extremely calming. But the gameplay is really what takes it to next level. The game play is simple but you need all your attention on it in order to succeed in the goals. 

Since your concentration is on the game and no longer on the anxiety it helps.
It works for me but may not for all but I would feel remise if I at least didn't offer it

TL:DR: if you have panic attacks try playing Altos Odyssey",Anxiety

1431,t3_di7d64,Fear of getting a hearthattack/dying,"Hello,
 so basically last 2 months were pretty rough for me. Me and my girlfriend decided to split up. I moved into new flat with my mom, because my parents divorced last year. I stopped seeing most of my friends, I felt generally sad and didnt want to talk to anyone. 
Anyway school started and anytime I went to school I didnt feel good in my stomach, felt like I am going to vomit and had to sit close to the door just to feel more comfortable. Sometimes he feeling got away, sometimes I was just worried and started sweating hard and just had to walk out of the school. Then I felt alright. I couldnt even eat properly, because I was afraid that i will vomit in the public and I find that just humilitating. When I couldnt sleep I was often thinking about that I wont wake up in the morning. 
I commute to school with a train once once a week and come home for the weekend. Last week when I was on my train home my chest started to hurt and I just felt pressure all over my chest.  I googled symptomps of hearthattack and had to go for a walk to breathe. I was really worried that Im gonna die there, was really frustrated, because I knew I would take a really long time for an ambulance to get there. Somehow I got home and felt better. The day after I again started feeling pain in my chest, it was like a brick on my chest and my whole body was burning. I told my mom about it and she looked after me whole night. Next day I had to commute to school again and was worried the whole way on that train, somehow I managed to get through it and got to my flat(in the another city) my friend wasnt there that day. I tried to not think about the pain and just started playing computer games. Couple hours later I stopped, because I just couldnt pretend like nothing is happening. I masturbated, because I felt like it might just be reliefing, anyway when I was finished my body just started shaking, I couldnt breathe and I though this is it, I am going to die, I didnt know whether to call ambulance or not, lied down, called my mom and just tried to breathe. It got better after couple of minutes but my chest was still hurting like hell. Now its quite better but sometimes it still hurt or my heath aches a bit, I am still thinking about death and its really uncomfortable. 
I was wondering if someone experienced similar thing or seen something like that. My hearth is fine, I was at the doctor and he told me I got nothing to worry about.

I’ve been learning from anxiety over the past 12 years since experiencing my first panic attack. 

It’s only more recently I’ve noticed what can trigger anxiety and periods of panic. 

Most recently I was with having dinner with a client. As soon as I walked into the restaurant it was very warm, I felt claustrophobic and I was already very tired from travelling around all week. It’s these three ‘externals’ which I find bring on anxiety. In this case at it’s height, the meal was difficult to eat and wanted to run out of that room as fast as possible. But at the same time the meal looked great and just wanted to eat after a long day. Things got better as the space became less claustrophobic when some tables cleared. Still I didn’t enjoy the meal as much as possible. Usually I love my food and fortunately don’t experience this on a daily basis.

Does anyone have similar experiences with these triggers and eating, or what heightens your anxiety?

The anxious energy is just looking to get wound up about something. Just see it for what it is - misguided energy and it won’t take you over. Thoughts don’t create anxiety the latent anxiety is already there waiting for thoughts to attach itself to. The thoughts just exacerbate the anxiety of the kind buys into the thought. Observe it objectively. Let it just be. Resistance will only make it worse. If you can just let it be it will eventually subside like an itch. It ebbs and flows. Don’t resist just let it come and go.

It happens when someone talks about their life and I imagine it. Or even if they aren't talking about it but I'm picturing it anyway. Two examples:
1. Me: ""How are you doing?"" Person: ""Oh, I'm okay, I just got off work and now I'm going to pick up my daughter from school. She's going to tennis after."" I very briefly get the image in my head of this person picking up her daughter and they're on their way to tennis. Simple.
2. I am walking down the street, just thinking stuff to myself. Some lady in scrubs walks by, carrying a nice purse. My mind imagines her getting a check from her nursing job and she goes online to buy a purse she's wanted for a while. Or I think, ""Where's she going? To work? Home from work? Does she go home to someone else? Does she stop at the store before home? Does she stop at a store and get a drink before work?
 And no matter what I think about them, I start to feel super uncomfortable. Like there's a pit in my stomach and my throat is almost warm feeling and I have to immediately stop picturing it or else I feel like I'll go into an attack.
And these things I picture are just examples. I don't dwell on their lives, I'll think one quick thing about their life and instantly get anxiety. And it's no specific person or type of person. It's anybody. Even people I know. Like when my mom describes her night to me I get it. I think the absolute only person this doesn't happen with is my boyfriend who I've been with for 6 years.

I'm taking every interview I get since it's been so long and it's extremely rare I even get a call or email reply to an application. I wasn't too nervous about the first interview, but had to let the offer go because I couldn't work the hours offered. 

I feel like this next interview tomorrow has me more on edge because I'm not as confident in my knowledge of what I'd be working with. It was tailored as an entry level job ideal for recent college graduates in the human services field, so this is basically the kind of job I'm going to find until I can get a higher degree or licensure. It seems like a good job, but I'm so convinced that I'm too incompetent for it. I kind of am incompetent in the sense that I don't really know some of things listed as duties, and I have no idea if they're taught through an orientation or not. I doubt they'd throw me to the sharks with what kind of job it is, but there's no bullshitting my way out of not knowing this stuff. I'm too honest of a person to even try lying during an interview anyway. 

I love my field of study and I'd like to work in something like this one day, so this job could be a good stepping stone to get to where I want to be. It's just that I'm such a people-pleaser that I freeze and panic when I'm incompetent or do something wrong. I'm too used to people blaming me for anything and everything, blowing up on me for simple mistakes. I can totally learn how to do these job duties, I just need the chance to learn them and I'll have it down quickly. 

It's times like this that I wish I'd just gone down the research route and I could be locked up in a lab with minimal contact right now. Strangely enough, I was actually confident about going for the ""more human contact"" route in the months around the start of my job search. I thought it was something I could handle, and I've actually improved on my social anxieties over the years. The thing is, I'm really only confident in social situations when I know what I'm talking about and what I'm doing, when I feel more control over the situation.

Then this evening my sister who is worse than I was decided she’d cough and breath all over me while sitting at school waiting for class. (Both college students)

So I get worse and the congestion hits, more sneezing, less coughing. I’m already wearing a hoodie in 90 degree weather cuz I have to typically stay warm/hot so I can keep congestion away. She goes off to class finally. And I get agitated over getting worse. I’m not feeling well having to listen to bullshit conversations with her. Finally it’s quiet. My professor says I can go on in even tho it’s not my class time and there’s a class on computers but desks are free. So I do. 

It gets worse! Everything has multiplied by a hundred and I’m just frazzled, agitated, and that’s when it happens...anxiety creeps in cuz one nostril is closed 95% and getting that blockage of ear canal when you swallow. I have a panic attack, but trying to remain calm. No one sees me. I’m hyperventilating. I can’t breath even tho I am, I’m breathing thru my mouth, but I am breathing. I bolted walked fast to my car and waited for my sister. Within 5 minutes my professor emails me, 

“You doing ok? I noticed you left.” And honestly, it was the most heartwarming email I’ve had in a long time. I’m happily married, I have a wonderful husband and not in some weird infatuation thing for a guy no he’s like twice my age. No, it just made the anxiety attack lessen that i didn’t say bye to someone and they noticed I left. I’m always the last one to leave at the end of the night. I’ve gotten to know my professor on a personal level with his health and mine. We both lost someone dear to us this past summer. And he’s just a great mentor and professor. 

It just felt nice. Of course I let him know just having some allergy issues. 

Then, I get home. Take some afrin that’s some bullshit. Didn’t help. My hubs who was sleeping, he has to be up 430 for work. I’m having another anxiety attack cuz I can feel the pressure in my head and I’m breathing but it feels like nothing is being taken in. I wake him and tell him to talk to me for a bit. I feel bad, but he totally understands. He’s seen me go thru this for now 10 years a couple times a year. He told me all about his day and he gave me his bottle of equate “Afrin” and boy that stuff works! I can breath in my nose mostly now. It’s runny again, I know gross. But the panic attack has moved on and I think I can go to sleep now. 

Just wanted to kind of vent about my loving husband and my panic attacks tonight over congestion. I feel like such a baby when it comes to being congested.",Anxiety

I am a researcher with the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR) and am currently conducting a study about the way corporations communicate about mental health.

My current study requires me to sample participants who have experienced anxiety, as I believe your voices are crucial in providing accurate communication and interventions.

To complete the study, I need about 200 participants. Therefore, I am offering a raffle for a $50 Amazon gift card for participation.

The questionnaire is completely anonymous and takes about 10 minutes to complete.

If you are at least 18 years old, employed and reside in the US, please consider participating.

The link for the questionnaire can be found here: [https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6glp56w9Uo23iNn](https://uvacommscience.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6glp56w9Uo23iNn)

1488,t3_di2f6z,Birthday anxiety,"Hello everyone. I have anxiety and I felt like sharing.

I have two main triggers that I’ve been able to identify: money and over reading people’s emotions. My parents separated when I was in middle school and went through a nasty divorce. My sisters then would treat my dad like an ATM whenever we visited. I never wanted to be a part of that because I saw how upset it made everyone. It got to a point of never getting things that I needed, like enough clothes that fit.

It got harder in college. The agreement included splitting living expenses through each of our college experiences. That rarely actually happened, they did a poor job of managing that. I worked more than I should have to earn enough to have a roof and food. My girlfriend, now my wife of 12 years, helped me out of that situation.

But now I can’t spend money without asking her first. 

My mother is narcissistic. It’s something my sister s and I have figured out over the past few years. It’s easier living several states away, she can’t bug me for things the way she used to. My dad had anger issues. I say had as I haven’t spoken to him in around four years now, but there’s a drama story for another time. Anyway, that meant a lot of arguments or embarrassing situations growing up. It made me very keyed up and over-reading people’s emotions. Useful when trying to avoid situations. 

Now, my birthday. It’s my birthday month! I’m very uncomfortable with my birthday. We moved so many times that it gradually became more and more difficult to celebrate my birthday. How many times did we move? Between K-12, I had 9 different schools. We aren’t a military family.

My parents started to be pretty lax towards my birthday. My birthday is on Halloween. Sounds like fun growing up, but after the divorce it meant two neighborhoods that got hit up heavily for trick or treating, taking everyone’s attention. After leaving for college, it felt like now that I wasn’t home such things could just be overlooked, with just a card in the mail or a Facebook post. I was at my mom’s place the day before my my first birthday as a married man for dinner. She didn’t acknowledge it beyond giving me a gaudy, blank photo album for wedding photos. I cried the entire drive home.

I started working with my doctor a few years ago to get on meds to control the anxiety. Last year I was on the third, and worst. I was getting several attacks a week. I had an attack at church during the worship music because of the crowd and the noise. I had an attack at group, among friends, at the thought of speaking about the reading.

My birthday last year found me at my worst. I had no desire to have people wish me a happy birthday on Facebook, the thought of all those posts made me anxious. So I removed my birthday from my profile. I did the same on all social media. No one at work knows when it is, with the exception of the admins that need it. I blocked off the day to minimize the number of meetings and hid in my room and worked. I definitely avoided the costume party at lunch.

But my worst? That was in the morning. We needed a couple of things from the store, so I went. On the way I started to feel an attack coming on, and felt the urge to drive onto the bridge over the river and jump. It was strong, and I had to fight myself to keep on route to the store. I made it there and cried in the car for fifteen minutes before going in. I only told my wife about that a couple of months later, right as I switched to my new med.

This year is going to be different. The new med has been wonderful, I feel like me. I’ve been on it for most of 2019 and I have only had two attacks. I haven’t felt the normal anxiety I get in October. I have been repeating positive affirmations about my birthday, making small plans with my wife (I’m not ready for celebrating with more than her and my girls). And then tonight I felt like posting this, my first post on a subreddit I’ve lurked on for awhile.

Also, I wanted somewhere I could keep everything in one place, from medication reminders to a food diary to just me generally venting, rather than having to juggle separate apps. So I decided to make my own. If you want to know more about my app journey, you can read about it here [https://bearable.app/blog/theoriginsofbearable/](https://bearable.app/blog/theoriginsofbearable/)

I have been talking in a private subreddit for the last few months with people with Anxiety, Depression, Fibromyalgia, CFS, MS, and other chronic conditions to try and make a mood and symptom journaling app that is effortless and intuitive to record into (especially given the brain fog that comes with many conditions), but still provides useful insights. The feedback I've received so far has been amazing and if all goes well the app will be released on apple and android in a few months!

However I want to get feedback from as wide a range of individuals with different circumstances and needs as possible, so I’m posting here to ask if you have any feedback on the current state of the app in my video and whether you have any feature requests that you would like to see. You can find the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okPITKLV0UU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okPITKLV0UU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Kind regards,

**Side note-** this is not a pity post. I understand that I allowed this to happen and take responsibility for everything. I am an adult, I make my own choices.

1500,t3_di1h08,This is the hardest time of my life so far,"I am working full-time and attending school full-time. I’m halfway through the semester and feeling stretched pretty thin. This is my last semester - I graduate in December and I can’t wait to actually have my degree. I’m a non-traditional student who didn’t care enough about their grades when they were younger. I had fallen into a bad pit of alcohol abuse, as alcoholism runs in my genetics. 

After two bouts of academic probation, I finally straightened up my act and went back full-time. I have been on the dean’s list for every semester since returning to school and am quite proud of myself.

However, being an anxious person, I can’t help but be hard on myself and self-doubt. What if I’m just not capable enough to do this? What if I freak out and go crazy before the end of the semester? What if I have a major health issue and am forced to delay graduation? It’s been so hard for me to feel good about this and I just want to relax and trust that I can get through this last 8 weeks of my educational career. My chest has been so tight lately and my head hurts all the time. I just need someone to tell me everything’s going to be okay and I’m going to get through this. :(",Anxiety

My family (hubby plus two kids) have been throwing up this evening. I came home from work to find the house in uproar (plus my littlest has a temp) so I had to rush round cleaning sick.. delight. But when it comes to me? I don't want to get sick. I know if it happens I can't stop it, but it's the not knowing when it's going to happen and the tummy ache before hand. In the past, whenever I get unwell with a sickness bug I have to hide myself away and you can't really do that with two young children- which doesn't help my anxiety.

Another reason why I don't want it is cos of work. I can't take any time of sick (if I do become sick) so I'm sitting here in the dark while everyone sleeps and I'm stressing and my belly is getting all knoty from stress.. I really hope it's stress :(",Anxiety

I struggle with taking Paxil (have rx for 10mg so very low dose) since I technically CAN manage it it just takes effort which in itself is exhausting.  Is that a normal feeling?  Can the majority of us manage symptoms with effort and should that even come into account in the decision?  
I guess what I’m asking is should I consider the meds so I can cope with minimal effort on my part?
I know this is confusing and hope someone understands what I’m trying to say and has some insight.
I do have a major stressor coming up (vacation which should be relaxing but stress about leaving home lol) so would rather start it sooner rather than later if this is the path I’m going to follow.

So I thought it was a good idea to report it to the mods, and I did and they said they removed it, but it’s still viewable by a link.I’m scared that if he reports it to the police they’ll wonder how i found it and they’ll investigate me. But before I did it I messaged the mod and he said they don’t report people To the police. I didn’t even post it, I just stumbled upon it and I reported it. The video had 1 million views on gfycat, and 6k upvotes on reddit.And they’ll get a search warrant for me and my life will be ruined, I’m scared because i got nudes one year ago, but they’ve been deleted for a year, but law enforcement can still find  it, and they’ll count it as possession. This has ruined my life it has given me depression, and anxiety. Depression makes it hard for me to wake up in the morning and anxiety makes it hard for me to sleep at night. I’ve lost motivation in everything, all I want is to be free, I just want this pain to be over. Im  scared that if I get caught my life will be ruined. I’m scared of having to register as a sex offender. I’m 15, and my life is ruined. I’m scared any day the cops will show up at my door. For doing the right thing, all I did was report something.

I don't think anything of it until an hour or two later, and then the anxiety starts pouring down onto me. It starts with the rubber band squeezing on my chest and the anxious energy of not knowing whether you want to punch something in the face or collapse and curl into a ball. A little bit later, the panic attacks come.

It might feel a little bit better if I knew how to push him from my brain. It's been almost a year and the memory of him still sends me into an anxious state.
It's not like he didn't ask permission to do things, he did, but I always said yes, to make him happy, but also to see if I could make myself love guys (I'm lesbian). He touched me, and kissed me, and I did nothing to stop him. Later on, after we had broken up, he told me that when he killed himself it would be my fault, among other things, and that if I wanted to get the project we had to do together finished, I'd need to ""swallow my pride"" and ""get off of my fucking high horse"". In reality, I was the one pulling all the weight and he would just complain.

After I was away from him for a little while, I started to get less anxious when I heard his name or remembered things about him. But it came back, because the new school year has started and I have to do things that we did together last year. I see people I only knew when I was with him. They all remember me as his gf. They ask me about him.
I don't know what to do. I've only just really come to terms with my sexual orientation, and because of that, what happened horrifies me even more, and the memories are extremely painful.

After some 20 minutes my bus arrived and I decided that I liked it and that there was no reason to stop there so I leaned on the window while standing, hands beside my hips, eyes closed, again, around a bunch of people.

1536,t3_dht0vw,My biggest win against anxiety so far: a book to open up about my anxiety (through drawings),"This is my first message here, I'm not used to talking here, but I've been appreciating lots of motivational messages in this subreddit so here's my part. 

Struggling with anxiety and panic attacks, I wanted to write something because I've felt very happy and proud of some challenges I accomplished in the past, but haven't been that happy then for this latest event I experienced.  Last week I launched a crowdfunding campaign (I'm not self promoting here, just talking about the experience of pushing myself to do this) to try and publish a book with drawings I do about my anxiety, and after a few days, the campaign has reached the initial funding!  As an illustrator with anxiety, and because of how much difficulties I've had in the past to put myself forward and look for jobs, etc..., this is a really big win (my biggest one against anxiety without a doubt), but mostly, it was the best way for me to open up about my mental health, and it was a very good thing for my morale.    

I wanted to share this because I've been in a better place lately, and was able to challenge myself to this degree. Looking back 2 or 3 years ago, I would have never thought I'd be able to do this. There's been a lot of failure, but keeping on going failure after failure eventually leads somewhere. I hope that makes sense, and I hope that can motivate some people, not to feel stuck where they are. You have to be patient, but you're not stuck where you are forever, and I hope you'll get to a point where there is more success then failure.  

Also, I've been drawing since I was a kid, but I have truly been feeling better because of this creative activity, and I invite anyone who doesn't do anything creative, to do it. Whatever your skills, whatever your domain, expressing your thoughts in a creative way, from my experience, helps a lot in personal development.

I hate to start off by saying I was doing so well... But i was! I was more involved, I was in club, I am volunteering, I asked my profs to work in their lab (fingers crossed on that still), I was working out, I was getting decent marks in premed

Then winter hit. Big oofs. My gf for 4 months saw me change into energy-sucking, anxiety-ridden, toxic creature. It is not the first time this has happened it has been a huge problem for every long term relationship I've ever had. Hell, I've even had one girl say ""you were the best bf ever in the summer, what happened?""

I know its cause my depression gets worse during the winter, and bc school and everything is a big stress, but I have gone better and I've tried so so hard. I been talking anxiety meds for over a year now. I feel like such a failure bc of the situation now tho and I feel like I'm back to my old ways.

I tried to get her to get back with me and i explained everything I am telling yall. i just feel so pathetic bc of it now. She's such a sweet gal and I just wish her the best and know she doesn't deserve the irratiable, fun sucking constantly anxious me. I was trying so hard for her, but so many things happened that one week...

1551,t3_dhy5dw,Tomorrow is my first-ever therapy appointment. What can I expect?,"I (19F) have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. From toddlerhood until now, I have always worried about anything and everything that could go wrong. It's like my brain is completely wired to the tenets of Murphy's law. I'm incredibly indecisive and I stress about things that most people would never bat an eye over. Moreover, I am extremely self-conscious and I obsessively overthink about how others perceive me. Even the most trivial situation can seem very daunting and send me into a shaking, sweating mess. Currently, I attend a community college, and with university fast approaching, my anxiety about the future has worsened. It's taken a serious toll on me, caused me to miss several opportunities, and is generally reducing my quality of life.

Despite showing symptoms of anxiety since childhood, I have never seen a psychiatrist, psychologist, or even a therapist (when it comes to mental health, my parents' insurance is complicated). I briefly mentioned anxiety to my doctor the last time I had a check-up two years ago, but I didn't follow up with anything. After debating whether or not my anxiety was severe enough to get help (and thus letting it eat away at me), I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and began researching local therapists. Last week, I mustered up the courage to call a place that was close to my house and recommended by the college. I was able to schedule an appointment - my very first appointment with a professional - for tomorrow.

From what I've heard, I know that finding a good therapist often involves a lot of trial and error, and that it can take years to find somebody who is right for you. For the sake of affordability, I opted to meet with a grad student supervised by a professional. It may not be as good as an appointment with a licensed professional, but I would just like to see how this goes and change this later if necessary.

What can I expect for tomorrow? What should I bring/prepare for? Where can I go from here? I am not looking to be diagnosed with anything just yet, nor am I seeking serious treatment, but I would like to begin figuring out the possibilities, and I feel that this is a step in the right direction.

I’ve never lurked or been on this sub before, but for my issue, I figured there would be a sub for it...

My fiancé has been struggling heavily with anxiety for years now, but recently, it has gotten extremely bad. She would be texting me asking for ingredients of food we’ve ate before because she thought she was having an allergic reaction, if she was feeling sick or dizzy, she would think she is dying and just having a hard time with everyday life. 

I have found that I am trying my best to help her, but I am struggling myself to find a way to communicate with her or to be better with her in these moments. Sometimes I do well, sometimes I forget about her problems when she’s having anxiety and I get frustrated, which leads to me not handling the situation well. 

I’m sure I am not the only person in this boat, but could someone please help me, help her. It kills me to see her this way everyday of her life.

1570,t3_dhv743,My anxiety is destroying my friendship,"Hi all,

Sorry for the extremely long post. Wasn’t sure where to post this but wanted some advice or maybe just to vent.

We’ve been best friends for probably 4 years now starting our 5th. About 2-3 years into our friendship, I (F, Bi, 28) fell for her (F, Straight, 31). We worked together and even shared our office. We would take lunch, go out after work, stay late, etc. What really caused me to have feelings were the sleepovers. She would sleepover at least once a week. She lived 15-20 minutes from work and so did I but in the opposite direction. The reason for the sleepovers were because we’d smoke and she’d get tired and fall asleep. We soon became inseparable. I quit the job and she followed suit not too long after and we went off to different jobs but continued our friendship as normal. She once said that she found it so bizarre when people would ask about our friendship as if we stopped seeing each other as often as we did when in reality, it’s like we never quit.

I told my best friend about my feelings and she was great. I was terrified that I was going to lose her as a friend but instead we talked it out and agreed that we didn’t want our friendship to change and keep it business as usual meaning, no time apart, keep hanging out, etc. At the time, I was in therapy and we had been working on telling my best friend. After I told her, my best friend and I were a little cautious and wanted to make sure that business as usual was a good thing. After discussing at length for many sessions, my therapist said that there was no need to create a distance and that at the end of the day, it didn’t take away from the fact that she was my best friend and one of my major support systems. 

Problem is: Sometimes, for no reason at all, I’ll feel like things are off or we’re disconnected. We text everyday and she calls me on the phone every night. The first couple times when she wouldn’t call me triggered this alarm of “what have I done?” I would start to panic and think that maybe she wanted distance from me and so I in turn would distance myself from her. 

It starts off as a no phone call from her. Then I wouldn’t get a text from her until about 3-4PM the next day. Things would be normal and then I’d be okay. Then something so ridiculous would set me off like once we had plans to see some a movie and she invited someone else. I took it as if she would have rather seen it with the other person but since I already knew about it, just had me come out of pity. Sometimes, I’m just jealous of her other friends replacing me. Another unwarranted fear. 

We don’t really argue, but rather, just kind of sit next to each other in this weird awkward silence and then just end the night. I have a hard time saying what bothers me and I’m always terrified that if complain or say what bothers me, that she’ll decide for me and say that we should stop hanging out. Also, I feel so stupid and ridiculous and immature for being upset over such small things. So instead of saying it, I just huff and puff in my head and shut down. After a week or two of no talking without explanation, I usually explain to her that I just needed time away because I was upset about whatever the trigger was.

When we had something like this happen last year, she said that when I stop speaking to her like that, it affects our friendship because it makes it seem like I harbor a ton of resentment towards her and that we’re not as close as she actually things we are. She gets frustrated when I don’t tell her what bothers me because it’s a convo that we have repeatedly and despite it all, I still don’t tell her how I feel when it’s the easiest thing to do. Shutting her out makes it feel like our whole friendship is at stake which is a horrible feeling for her because we’re inseparable in her mind. She gets frustrated because she gets to be the happiest and goofiest version of herself when she’s with me but I take that away when I’m upset. I never forgot about that. Since then, I’ve stopped doing that whole no talking thing because it is immature and I don’t want to take anything away from her just because I’m upset.

But now it’s back again and I can’t shake it. I was moving a few months back and was so overwhelmed with looking for a new place. Someone offered to help me and came with me to look at the apartments. I was bothered that she never offered to help until the last day. I wasn’t really in a talkative mood during the move due to the stress of it all and so she just took it as the move. Once I got settled in, she became busy at work. It had been about 3 weeks since we last saw each other, minimal phone contact. I texted her and some days she was more responsive than others. We still went out and saw movies or had dinner at least once a week but they were kind of quiet and awkward. We went to an event together and things were good until she went to hang out with other people and left me alone (albeit at my behest). On September 19, we went out to dinner and things seemed to be somewhat better. I had mentioned that our friend was going to Peru on her honeymoon. She said “yikes, I hope she’s not there when I’m there.” Puzzled, I said — “when are you going to Peru?” She said “October” and I said — oh, are we still going to Brazil like we planned? And she said yes. The reason I was so bothered was because in January she asked me to go with her to Brazil in October. As I started to get the funds, she said can we make it NYE instead. I said sure. In July, she said we’d have to postpone the trip because she didn’t have the money. So I said, no problem. So to casually find out that she was going away took me by surprise. I had expressed my frustration and she said that she bought the trip last August and wouldn’t tell me she couldn’t afford something then do it with someone else. She understood my disappointment but was looking forward to our trip. I let it go. This past Thursday, she told me she was excited for the trip. I asked her when she was leaving, she said Saturday. It just bewildered me that she bought these tickets in August 2018 and I’m really just getting details about it two days prior for two people who are “inseparable.” I’m trying not to be a jealous prick but its frustrating. At the same time, I feel like I’m the paranoid one who’s creating all this in my head. Right now, I feel like I pushed her away so many times by withdrawing and now she’s just moved on to other friends and it’s causing me to want to be distant from her.

TL; DR — I feel like I’m going to lose my best friend because my insecurities are manifesting and I’m creating arguments for no reason. I don’t want my anxiety to ruin this friendship. Tips?

I’m constantly thinking about how I’m gonna die, will it be painful? Will I suffer? Will people even know how I died? Will I get tortured? Will I go in my sleep peacefully? Will I even live to accomplish my goals? Will I get married? Will I have kids? What if I die while giving birth? Car accident? Kidnapped? All these things go through my head and it drives me insane sometimes. All anyone ever says is that death is inevitable and I’m gonna just have to try not to think about it but shit! It’s difficult!

Until I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 20. I am now 22 and still learning. I have a really hard time with money troubles and always worrying I’ll never have enough to get by. Lately I find myself not being able to get a job and that has triggered me really badly.

Managed to calm myself down somewhat, but I couldn’t fall back asleep. My alarms to get ready for work went off 30 min ago, yet I’m too drained to get ready. I also feel like I could throw up at any moment, too. I call out of work almost once a month due to these types of attacks (or I have massive ones at work where I’m sitting on the floor in a bathroom for 30-40 min). I just started going back to counseling to help treat my anxiety, but right now I feel like I’m back at square one. What else can I do?",Anxiety
1583,t3_dhuats,Off my Chest,"This constant feeling around the heart that appears like clockwork the moment I wake up in the morning to the moment I go to bed at night. Subsiding in cool bliss while driving with the music blaring along the highway at speeds that would make a mother shudder. Or while walking during a cool night with music in my ears and hair frozen due to winds. But it truly never goes away, simply looming in the background. But flaring up like the true pits of Hell itself when I wake up from a simple nap or try and eat some food.

Sometimes it flares up so badly that i’m lying awake at 4 AM not being able to even go to sleep. No apparent reason for the flare up, just why not I guess? It’s at those times that I wonder what it would be like to point a gun at my heart and pull the trigger, maybe i’d finally have some true bliss. I never go ahead and do it of course partially because I don’t actually own a gun. I’m not suicidal, at least not now. 

I was a Senior in High School when I found out that this wasn’t normal. That the constant feeling around my heart was supposed to...naturally stop eventually. That this wasn’t supposed to be constant. All the time I had thought the people around me were dealing with the exact same thing. That people who were confident and outgoing simply had it subside far more often. But nope, I just wasn’t normal.

I started keeping track of it then, as a reference point to say “yes, this is exactly when it started”. Late 2017/Early 2018 is what the date said. But inside of me, I knew it didn’t start then. I remember it as far back as Late 2012. We had just moved to a new town and the 2012 Doomsday was in my mind. It might of even started before but my memory is a bit fuzzy.

People who had watched me grow up from birth till now remark on how I have gotten quiet, more reserved. Not like the outgoing little kid that was jumping across chairs and being the center of a gathering. It’s soul crushing knowing that I wasn’t like this my whole life. That this feeling had been going on for so damned long I had forgotten what it was like to be free.

I know there are others out there whose situations are far worse than mine. People who can’t even function in society because of how crippling it is. Just imaging it is heartbreaking, I might face something a tenth of what they face.
Comparatively i’m as normal as every other soul walking down the street. I can hold down a job, have conversations, and even make friends with people. Sure, I might not be the first one to volunteer for a presentation or tell that girl over there her dress is cute. Sure this feeling might be constant, going up and down as the day goes by but never truly going away. But at least I can function.

1584,t3_dhmor3,Girlfriend wants to break up me because of anxiety. What should I do?,"I (27M) have been dating this girl (27F) for 1 year now. Both of us love each other a lot. In the last one year we have never fought. We are compatible, complement each other really well, can't keep our hands off each other. ..the whole nine yards. She now wants to break up with me because she is suffering from anxiety &amp; needs some time off to fix it.

Before dating me, she was dating her ex-boyfriend. They had been dating for 4 years &amp; wanted to get married. It came to a point where she had to either choose her family or him. She chose her family. We had known each other for 4-5 months up to that point &amp; had a crush on each other but couldn't make a move since she was already in a relationship. 1 month after her break up, we started dating.

She's told me about her anxiousness before &amp; so this isn't completely new to me. She says she doesn't feel very confident these days. Doesn't like being alone. She starts having negative thoughts whenever she is by herself. She feels like like she didn't completely heal from her previous relationship. In her own words - she's lost a part of herself. I asked her if she still loves her ex &amp; wants to go back to him. She says she doesn't &amp; I believe her.

She's had this anxiousness for throughout the last one year since when we have been together. In the last 6 months, she put in a lot of effort to curb these negative thoughts, take one day at a time &amp; think optimistically. But that hasn't helped her. She says she hates that she can't be alone these days. She wants to be ok &amp; wants these negative thoughts to go away. She said she tried taking one day at a time but that didn't work. So, she wants to break up with me completely because she wants to spend some time alone &amp; heal from her previous relationship. She thinks that is the root cause of her anxiousness &amp; being alone will help us fix her anxiety. I told her that her reasoning doesn't add up - how will being alone help her? Shouldn't she have someone to help her through this. She said she feels like she depends a lot on me &amp; doesn't like that. She wants to be ok when she is by herself. She is also not sure if breaking up will help but for her mental sanity, she wants to try.

From talking to her, I sensed a bit of guilt in her. She really loves me &amp; feels guilty that I always have to be there for her or try to fix her. She thinks it isn't fair on me to deal with her issues. Also, if it doesn't work out in future she doesn't want to see me hurt. I believe some of this comes from her ex-boyfriend's reaction to their breakup. For at least 9 months after their break up he used to message her everyday with things like I still love you etc. And I have seen her personally get very upset on seeing those messages &amp; feel responsible for his breakdown &amp; probably doesn't want me to go down the same path.

I love her...so much. In an ideal world, we would be together &amp; happy. But even if we aren't together, I want her to be at peace. What can I do to help her? I have suggested that she see a therapist &amp; I am trying to push her to see someone. I am there for her. I am trying to understand her &amp; am standing by her like a rock. What else can I do?",Anxiety

1600,t3_dhsog3,Breathing techniques and resources,"Years of inertia and not taking myself and my life seriously had built up terrible anxiety in me. I would like to share some breathing techniques which have helped me immensely, firstly you need to be aware of your triggers and your current state when you're anxious( for me it is feeling my heartbeat, uncomfortable lump in the throat and mind racing as if everything needs to be understood and done right away, basically being overwhelmed). I personally don't go to a therapist because it's hard to find a good one and I don't want to take medication for anxiety( lack of trust in the pharma/doctor industry).

I think the best way to deal with your anxiety is self-awareness, self-knowledge and educating yourself. understanding the basis of your neurosis is very important. Acceptance of your situation and coming up with realistic measures will surely help. Here are a few breathing techniques(since the way you breathe and state of your mind are directly connected and vice versa) and resources to learn from. These are yogic techniques so you have to focus on your breathing and try not to get distracted.

1. Sit on a chair/floor with your back straight, legs crossed, close your eyes, place your hand on your tummy take deep breaths in and out, you should feel your tummy expanding, first few breaths just focus on the tummy expanding with every inhalation, then focus on making your inhalations and exhalations equal, like this inhale 1,2 exhale 1,2, do this for about 3-5 mins continuosly.
2. second is the same but lying down on your back, knees bent, feet on floor at a comfortable distance and hand on the tummy. The whole idea is that we take shallow breaths when we are anxious and by doing diaphragmatic breathing and focussing we're relaxing and shifting the body into the parasympathetic nervous system.
3. for this one you stand place your hands on the lowest two ribs, take deep breaths and feel them expand with inhalation and contract with every exhalation.
4. again standing place your fingers on the clavicle bone by raising your arms and feel them move forward with every inhalation this is called clavicular breathing.

Since these are yogic techniques it will be best if you learn from a yoga teacher but i have listed them in case anyone is unable to go to one for any reason. And yoga doesn't look at the mind in isolation but as part of a mind, body,emotion, energetic system.

1601,t3_dhlb8v,"I often feel depressed, anxious and as if though I have missed out on a lot of life experiences, and there is one constant question in my mind which I feel is a huge part of this negative impact. 'What if?'","For most of my life I have dealt with depression and anxiety. Dealing with both of these mental illnesses for most of my life has been horrible, with both feeding the other endlessly. Whenever I've felt anxious, there's always been one thought in my mind. 'What if?' What if I say the wrong thing and I upset this person? What if I suck at this hobby? What if I ask this person out and they say no? As I'm sure many of you may relate, my inner response to these questions always seems to be forming the worst case scenario. So what do you do when you're in this situation? You avoid it! This has always given me a temporary relief, but then the depression kicks in. Why? Because of this avoidance you become isolated. You feel lonely. You're missing out on all of life's experiences.

A few months ago I was in a club with people I consider close friends, when someone I wasn't familiar with, but my friends were, started having a conversation with them. I sat there listening, not saying a word. I didn't know the guy, I wasn't sure how to get involved in the conversation, and then the anxiety kicked in. 'What if your friends think you're boring?' 'What if they realize you're boring and don't want to be friends with you anymore?' This was amplified because a girl I really liked was there, and to be seen as boring by her would be a horrible feeling. Note, I haven't asked this girl out or told her I like her in that kinda way because 'what if I ask her out and she doesn't want to remain friends anymore?' That 'what if' again. The anxiety fueled my depression, and next thing I know I'm outside the club and about to jump off a bridge. Thankfully a police officer was there. He talked to me and then pulled me down. He drove me home and told my parents what happened. Myself and my parents were obviously upset. 

Over the past 2 months since the incident on the bridge I have been going to a therapist my parents booked, and to anyone who this story may relate to and hasn't gone to therapy, I seriously advise giving it a shot. It has helped me a lot. I talk about feelings I would usually keep bottled up, and it is refreshing to hear someone else's perspective on your own thoughts. I talk to my therapist about a lot of my anxieties, and while it's certainly not easy and I'm still trying to challenge my thoughts, I am making progress. An example some may relate to is organizing a trip out with people. I have hardly initiated events in the past. Again, 'what if people can't come?' 'What if the event you organize sucks and people won't want to hang out with you anymore?' But when I talked to my therapist I realized something. It's not the end of the world. It's a day out you're trying to organize. So what if people can't come? People live busy lives and make other plans. It's nothing to stress over, plan something for another day. So what if it doesn't go well? Laugh and joke about it. Learn from it and do something different next time. 

With anxiety we make situations seem so much more challenging than they need to be, and of course it's difficult to challenge our thoughts, but it's not impossible. Say to yourself 'it's not the end of the world'. Try to look at things from someone else's perspective. When I talked to my therapist about being on that bridge I said to him 'it was a stupid thing for me to do.' He then stopped me and said 'if a friend of yours was sat on a bridge feeling suicidal, would you say they were being stupid?' Thats when I realized, 'no, I would sympathize with them and want to help them'. We are so hard on ourselves sometimes that we forget to love ourselves and acknowledge our achievements. It's important we all challenge our anxieties. Planning events, meeting up with people, applying for jobs... These are all parts of life. So what if you don't get that job interview? Loads of people probably applied for it. Figure out what else you can apply for and learn from any possible mistakes. What's the worst that can happen if you tell that girl you like her? She might say no, but hey, at least now you know you can move on and hey, chances are they'll probably still want to remain friends with you. So you know what? I'm gonna try to start going out my comfort zone. I'm gonna plan trips out with my friends, and if they don't work out, I'll try again. I see a job ad that sounds interesting, I'm just gonna upload my cv and instead of staring at the send button for half an hour feeling anxious, I'm gonna force my finger on the mouse and click 'send', and I'm gonna meet up with that girl I like and say, 'I like you. I don't know if you like me. If you want to go out with me that's great. If not I understand but I hope we can still be friends.' Maybe these things work out. Maybe they don't, but at least I can find peace in knowing that I tried and gave it my best effort, instead of sitting there worrying about what might happen.",Anxiety

I thought I was fine because in the process of adjusting I honestly forgot what I had been like pre-medication, but over nine months (too long) I've slowly come to terms with the fact that I'm not okay. (I'm going to my doctor this week to get it sorted).

I was wondering if anxiety is capable of making a mundane thing feel like life or death? (Tried googling but found it very hard to find results) My boyfriend made a decision that ultimately shouldn't matter that much, but it has slashed me to the core and I feel betrayed. All he did was vote Conservative in the up-coming Canadian election, but for compounding reasons this has greatly effected me. If I see anything about the election I have to leave or risk crying due to thinking about his vote. When I see him it immediately comes to mind. I wouldn't even say I'm that invested in politics.

I'm just looking for any reason why I feel this way, because I can't live with myself constantly feeling as if he's acting against me when I know he isn't. Yet that's how it feels?? As if his vote against my party is actually a vote against me, as if his mother (who is a terrible person + conservative) has won and turned him against me.

For those of you who don’t know: Appxiety is a tiny team of people just like you, who are suffering/have suffered with anxiety and wanted to join the fight in beating it. Think of this as an app created by us -- for us.

Essentially it works like this -- when you’re feeling anxious or having a panic attack, pressing one of the fire icons on the app will connect you to somebody to talk to. We hate the idea of being in pain alone.

You’ll be connected to other users on the app, as we felt who better to speak to, than somebody who knows EXACTLY what you’re going through.

If you’re feeling good and want to be the one that others come through to, you can select the “superhero” icon and it will link you with somebody who wants to chat.

If this anxiety thread has shown us anything -- it’s that as horrible as it is to have anxiety, there’s a very warm and understanding community of people who love to help each other -- a #AnxietySociety if you will.

We were searching for a way to connect everybody to this understanding and warmth not just quicker, but also easier.

Please give our app a go as we’d love to hear your feedback! Also, let us know your thoughts on the rest of the app’s features like “Tranquilo” and “Anxiety Chronicles.”

1605,t3_dhnm5p,I don't know who I am anymore (loss of personality/identity and disconnection from everyone),"I can't joke around anymore. I feel like I have no personality or have the ability to be genuinely happy. The last time I remember feeling genuinely happy was freshman year of high school or middle school. In social interactions, I get anxious because my mind goes blank and I have nothing valuable to add to conversations. By ""valuable,"" I mean something that speaks to my personality. Some people crack jokes and are sarcastic. Most of my responses are serious and boring. I wasn't always like this though. I was easy to entertain and would laugh at almost everything. I used to smile a lot too and never got anxious in social situations. I think I was relatively easy to talk to and outgoing. Pretty confident with some minor insecurities. I also joked a lot more and was just ""myself,"" whatever that meant back then. 

**Everything felt natural before**. 

Now, my life is consumed with dullness and anxiety. I can't get pass the superficial small talk when I meet someone new. By superficial I mean ""hey how was the test? that sounds rough. How was your weekend?"" When I talk I feel monotone and boring. I also became such an awkward person because of this inability to connect with others or have this natural feeling. Even if I find something funny, I just can't really laugh. If someone says something witty, I just can't keep up. I usually just say something simple, which kills the vibe from the person and the conversation. Most of the time, my laugh is forced and fake, which if detected can leave awkward vibes. Sometimes I also make facial expressions in relation to the topic of conversation and just stay silent. This inability to ""connect,"" also transitioned on to my family and other people in my life I appreciate, not just new faces. 

I believe the change began once I moved to a different high school. But I only really noticed everything until I was in a relationship with my current boyfriend. The same thing started happening a couple of months down. I was usually silent and didn't talk or joke around much. It only happened around him. Around other ""school friends,"" and family I felt louder. However, these feelings amplified once I realized how friendless I was senior year. These ""school friends,"" were only school friends. There was little to almost nothing outside of class. I suppose it was my fault too for not asking them out , but I just felt like the connection just was not there. I also became insecure because my boyfriend was still great friends with someone he was incredibly in love with in the past. His whole friend group was in love with her at the time too. She was not outgoing or well known, but she was charismatic and witty. My cousin also revealed to me at the time that she had a huge crush on her as well.  My anxiety increased even more when a friend blatantly said that they preferred hanging out with someone else other than me. I don't have a problem with friends hanging out with other friends, but the fact that he said it without a care in front of a small crowd definitely left a mark on me to this day. 

I also realized that my boyfriend seemed much more energetic and happy with others. He was joking with others and they were joking with him as well. Their energies matched his. He never did much to hurt my self-esteem. In fact, he was loving and really gave and is giving everything in the relationship. I always feel guilty when I look back at my behavior, at my silence, at my inability to continue a conversation, at my inability to laugh and feel relaxed, at my self-conscious thoughts. He always seemed ""not himself,"" around me. It was as if he lowered his energy for me. His laugh was different with me as well. 

This past summer was filled with cries, anxious thoughts, silences, and depression. I rarely went out because I had little to no friends to interact with. My social anxiety also increased to a point where I never thought it'd reach. When I went out with my boyfriend, I always felt on edge. We smoked a lot of weed. When we went on dates, there was laughter but not genuine ones. At parties, I always felt awkward. I had to leave one early because the anxiety was unbearable. That same night he confessed that he felt my tension, which made me feel even worse about myself. 

Now I'm in college. Did the symptoms get worse? Definitely. I have little to no friends. I isolate myself in order to ""keep my awkward image,"" a secret. My boyfriend on the other hand is thriving and having the best time of his life. I've never seen him smile or laugh or even dance so freely. His confidence spiked really quickly. He talks to everyone effortlessly and made so many cool friends that are fun and happy. He goes out a lot more and told me he's never felt better. He was also struggling with depression, but I don't think to the same extent as me. I feel so happy and envious at the same time. I've also felt disappointed in myself that I am not living up to my own expectations. I should be enjoying college. I always have this weird hope that I will overcome this. I just don't know how. I want to be genuine and I want to be proud of myself and live in a bold manner. I want to laugh like the girls I see everyday after my morning classes. I want to feel natural and not live in this cycle anymore. 

I do think I have GAD, specifically social anxiety. But at the same time, when I try to ""put myself out and keep trying,"" the same cycle happens. Is this anhedonia? Feeling little to no pleasure in things that are supposed to give you pleasure? Feeling almost emotionless when it comes to jokes? Not being able to joke around anymore? Feeling hopeful at times but unmotivated to do anything? Crying too much? Fake laughing? Fake smiling? Constantly in my head? Having trouble feeling grounded? Brain fog here and there? I don't know who I am anymore. Are there any treatments for something like this? I feel like I need a reboot on my brain. Any medication I could take? CBT? Any tips and self-care guides?

Ive taken as needed (.25mg) Xanax since early in high school. At that time, I actually had panic disorder and I didn't need a daily medication.

Ive had chronic insomnia since I was 19 and wanted to see if discontinuing Adderall might help. It didnt help. I went back on it February of this year after personal life and school stress made everything way too hard to handle. Going back on the Adderall helped with concentration immediately but also had a noticeable effect on my mood. At which point I started examining the increase in anxiety id been ignoring.

1612,t3_dhp947,Work Life Balance or Work Life Harmony? What should we be looking for to help ease our anxious lives? The most important thing is to find joy and purpose in both.,"Work-Life balance may be difficult depending on your current situation, business owners or shift workers may definately know that feeling, finding the perfect balance may not exist for some, these days its almost impossible to find a 50/50 solution to work and home, so instead of trying to figure out how to balance it all, we should try find out how to create harmony in everything that we do, including work.

Whether your life is heavily occupied by work or by your personal life, even with out achieving balance the goal is to find peace and harmony in all that you do.  If you work back often, but find joy and purpose in it, is that really a bad thing? If the balance is out but the joy is there both at home and work, aren't you still winning?  Why can't we be proud of the work we do?

Find a job you like and you'll never work another day again.

Happiness though also begins at home.

The key is not to find the balance between the two, but to have harmony at both.  Have peace everywhere you go.  Life is so busy these days that balance is becoming a myth, but harmony is still possible.

I know that isnt always easy, bad bosses, stressful jobs, no satisfaction, long hours (which no one wants)...I get it...but its important to put things in perspective, particulary at work, we owe it to our souls to find the good.  Unfortunately for most of us not working isnt an option, so for our own sakes we should atleast find the joy in it.  Try new things, experiment with your role a little and see if theres a spark.

Theres no harm in loving or atleast finding joy in what you do, providing of cause your personal / home life isnt suffering.

Yourself and Family first! but happiness and harmony every else doesnt hurt either. Finding joy 24/7 is sure better then 12/7.

Take care, wishing you the best in all that you do.",Anxiety

I think ive made the right decision to stay home, I see this couple a lot and cancelling once is not a big deal.

This coworker and I had been slowly becoming friends over the whole year, but we suddenly got really close over the summer.  We both struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression, and we took care of each other when we were down.  We spent entire days together, we baked, we cuddled, we talked about getting into (low-tier) competitive dancing or gaming together, we started planning weekend trips. Outside the regular problems with anxiety, I was the happiest I could remember being in years.  I think a few of the good weeks in there were actually some of the happiest of my life.

And then both of us hit some really bad anxiety.  They withdrew, I reached out.  For weeks and weeks.  I just finally asked point-blank if we could talk, and asked if I'd done something wrong, what was going on.  And they said they couldn't handle my anxiety or depression and don't enjoy hanging out anymore, and won't from now on unless it's some group activity we both happen to be part of.

They're so important to me, and I care so much about them.

Just by being themself, just by being this vibrant amazing person that I couldn't help but admire and aspire to be more like.

&amp;#x200B;

This had been such a big year for me in terms of tackling my anxiety.  I'd gone out and made friends, found some relief in CBD, spent some time in therapy (\^guess \^I \^should \^go \^back).  I'd started reaching out to a few friends when I needed support, and tried really hard to be vulnerable both for my own sake and in case it helped them feel comfortable being vulnerable with me.  And now it turns out that was the wrong thing to do, and I'm questioning and regretting so much.

I fucked it up and drove them away with my anxiety.  They're one of my favorite people in the world and I fucked it up.

1643,t3_dhoac5,Looking for advice on what I should do regarding medications.,"Looking for advice about medications...

Two years ago I began taking antidepressants. Not for anxiety, or depression, but for supposedly chronic migraines, I have even had multiple botox treatments for it. However a little bit ago I had an epiphany. 

I have thought for a while that I have some form of anxiety, but after looking into it more, a lot, a lot, of things that happen to me link to anxiety. 
Anxiety and stress can cause bad headaches, and various other effects I have. 

Initially when I began taking medication for my headaches I thought they were due to stress. My father however believes that I don’t know what stress is. But after two years of doing my own research and trying to figure out what triggers my headaches, I want to say that he is wrong.

So. Long story short. I want to talk to my family doctor and tell them what I think and see what they say. The main thing I am worried about is since I am already on an antidepressant (amitriptyline) for the migraines, would I be put on another? Or have them swapped out? And if I switch will my headaches get worse again... Should I cancel my botox appointment for next week when I am confident that the headaches stem from stress?

I guess the only way to know is to talk to my doctor, but I was just wondering if anyone had any helpful advice.",Anxiety

1645,t3_dhj8r4,EFT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) have been working for me.,"TL;DR - Lifestyle changes and meds weren’t enough so I started ACT and EFT and they seem to be working. 



Hi, everyone. :) I spend a lot of time here when things aren’t going well, but I wanted to pop in when something seems to be going right. 

I am working weekly with relatively new (for me) therapist and we have been digging in and addressing my GAD which seems to always come down to my intense fear of discomfort and dying. We tackle it for an hour each week and, as it’s not something anyone gets out of, it is something I seem to be coming to peace with - which is about as good as it can get, honestly. 

I do weekly chapters from a book called “Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life” and he gave me a couple handouts (copies of another workbook, I suspect) on EFT. These handouts include the karate chop point tapping with a phrase, and the 9 Gamut Procedures. 

I have significant lifestyle changes including reduced fat, sugar, and caffeine consumption; 30 minutes of walking daily (at least five out of seven days a week); addressing a vitamin D deficiency, a regular sleep schedule (currently looking into possible sleep apnea); drinking enough water; and taking 15mg buspar three times a day. These changes helped me get a handle on some of my health anxiety but the panic attacks and anxiety did not stop, unfortunately. I am having success with the ACT and EFT, however, and have hope to see the direction this takes me. 

I turned 32 yesterday (yey!) and have been facing my mental health head on since I was 28. I have come a LONG way and am sober since about February so this stretch has been particularly dreadful, but I am hopeful. 

[Here](https://www.thetappingsolution.com/eft-articles/remember-to-roll-your-eyes-a-deeper-understanding-of-the-gamut-point-procedure/) is a link that explains a bit about EFT for those interested.

Long story somewhat short in the 2 hours the husband was home he smoked 25 cigarettes and drank 15 beers but the cigarettes are the key here. I didn't end up leaving because I had no way to besides just waking out and my anxiety just had me pinned in place so every one of those cigarettes where all in my face. I wish I was exaggerating. I finally got out because they noticed I wouldn't stop coughing so they asked my mom to take me, she did and I'm currently on her couch. The problem is, is that I can't stop coughing no matter what I do I've been out of that place for two days so I figured it would've died down. I don't smoke and I never have. I used to have asthma as a kid really bad to the point I needed breathing treatments. I'm just wondering if anyone has insight on what I should do or be worried about or if I'm over reacting. Id love to talk to someone who's been through something similar. I've tried, Cough drops, (four of them so far,) I've tried numerous cups of throat lining soothing tea, getting outside time but I'm losing sleep because it's not going away.

She’s helped ease my panic attacks and give me hope and something to want to live for during my darkest moments. Shes not sick or suffering. She’s simply too old and losing basic motor and cognitive functions. The vet recommended it and it was ultimately my choice. I made the choice for her because I owe her that.

1648,t3_dhkkiy,"Life has become so overwhelming, and I feel like I just want to give up","To be clear, I don't mean ""give up"" like I'm suicidal. But so many things have happened and it feels like things just keep getting worse. I can't keep up, and I wish I could just give up, get rid of everything and have a long break from it all.

In the last few months it seems that everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong:

I worked a very stressful summer job where I struggled to get along with anyone, and ended up with a poor final evaluation. My mom was diagnosed with cancer and has been hospitalized 5 times in 4 months, including on my birthday. My brother who has anger issues became so stressed he lashed out at my mom and I, and so my family wont speak to each other except with me in the middle of it all. I have to do anything my mom asks because she needs so much extra help. But her sickness has also made her bitter, irritable and easily angry, and she often takes it out on me. I got severely sick which put me behind in starting school and other work/commitments this semester. I'm now a month and a half behind, having done almost no school work because I haven't had time with everything else. My cat also recently became sick and has to be on medication for the rest of his life. His care is now my full responsibility, including feeding him, giving him his meds, cleaning up after his messes. It's so stressful that even taking care of myself is a struggle: some days I refuse to eat, or forget to shower for days at a time, and my sleep is all over the place. A few times I've been in bed all day because I've been so emotionally and mentally exhausted.

I see a therapist every 1 or 2 weeks, but it's not enough. I can't talk to my family about my problems because 1) they're part of the problem, and 2) my family sucks at being supportive. I do have a good amount of friends, but all of them live far away except my boyfriend, who is on a different sleep/work schedule than me so it's hard to find the time to see each other and talk. But anytime I do reach out to any of my friends, I feel like I only have negative things to say about how stressful my life is. I feel like a burden to them and like I can't reach out to them anymore.

I have no motivation to do anything and don't know who I can speak to when I feel this awful. I'm so lost.",Anxiety
1649,t3_dhdt2u,I think this video could help a lot of people.,"I watched this TED talk (which came out two days ago), in which the speaker talks about - what he believes to be - the source of the increasing anxiety and depression amongst people in today's world. And I really think he's onto something.

So I thought I'd post this because perhaps it might help someone understand their (excessive) anxiety a bit better and figure out what they have to do to overcome it.

Even though the video is geared slightly more towards depression, the speaker also talks about anxiety and I think what he says generally applies to anxiety as well.

She has a lot of stuff on her plate right now: Med school, finals, she is trying to get into college which is in my town, driving lessons, and understandably (knowing how med school is in my country and, well, everywhere else) she doesn't have time for a relationship.

Now, we come to the problem: I'm so used to people (well, not necessarily people in general, but people I considered friends) leaving me, ignoring me, and not liking me in general (bar a couple of friends) that when we talk over Instagram DMs, and it takes her a while to answer, it's like a switch flips in my brain and I just start imagining the worst. That she wants to leave, she doesn't like me anymore,.... And then that sinking feeling, that void in my chest appears again.

Oh yea did I mention she lives in another city??

So I ended up transferring universities this semester. I really enjoyed the university itself, but I'm pretty sure that the desert it was in was having a big effect on me. The first and fourth quarters were particularly rough for me. Fourth quarter was especially difficult, and I had trouble functioning at times. During this time, I felt extreme sensitivity to light, irritability, depressed mood, lack of motivation, trouble sleeping, headaches, irrational anger, sensitivity to sound, my head felt like it was filled with cotton, chest pains around my heart area, and a constant feeling of hopelessness and doom. I felt like I had to get out of that state as soon as possible while this was all happening. Since not being in the state, I have not felt these feelings, although they will rarely resurface as dim echoes of what I felt before.

Does this sound like it could be anxiety? I have not felt something like this since going to that state, nor have I felt something quite as bad since leaving. I am really worried that it may have been something trivial that would have fixed itself, and that I left some of the best friends I have ever had just for some bad weather.

So, one of the main ways my anxiety manifests itself is by trying to speed up everything like it’s urgent af while I plan out all the possible scenarios that could exist. Then I also glaze over emotions and situations. It’s really hard for me to describe, but sometimes it’s like feeling an emotion and yet most of it’s still underwater like an iceberg. 

But I’ve really been working to get better and to pay attention to what my body is telling me and to be mindful of feelings. 

I feel very calm tonight. Not to say that I’m really happy because I’m grieving recent losses this year still and there’s been some crappy things this year to deal with. But I could sit with those emotions and be comfortable. For example, I’m a nurse and I’ve been glazing over how shitty the career has been lately. It’s not that I don’t like it most times and enjoy some of its perks, but there’s terrible stressors and very intense, sometimes very unfair working conditions at most places you go to. It’s issues wide spread across the profession. And I am, I guess “appreciating”, the whole spectrum of emotions about work tonight and feel calm. Worry over little things, like I’m working on my credit score or I need to schedule a lot of appointments this month, isn’t there. And while I feel pain and disappointment over my losses, I also feel relaxed and I can feel where the tension starts in my body. Then I feel a lot of love for my family that died and feel their love too. And that’s warm and I wouldn’t be able to have that feeling if I was running inside because of anxiety.

I have since went to the doctor and had X-ray on my lungs which came back clear and blood test taken which came back fine. I am awaiting an ECG appointment on Wednesday. 

I am 29, never have and don’t smoke/drink, I regularly run around 7km at a decent time under 40 mins, I consider myself fit.

I am feeling a little anxious again and I am not sure if I am just having panic attacks. I haven’t suffered with this feeling before of shortness of breath, chest pain and dizziness. I feel like I am perhaps getting myself overly wound up and it’s leading to this feeling. 

Is there any techniques you have in relation to shortness of breath issues that you can advise me with to combat this feeling.

1681,t3_dhin6e,"Guilt, shame and being apologetic.","I have a pretty strong guilt complex. I constantly feel like guilt when interacting with others, and like I need to apologize for my existence. I also feel like I need to feel ashamed of being who I am. Behavior wise I’m getting better at not expressing this, not constantly verbalizing apologies, etc but the internal feelings are still the same. It’s especially  prominent in romantic relationships.

I often feel guilty when someone is interested in me, and feel even more guilty when doing anything that would make them either more attracted or uncertain. For instance if I get a text, I feel guilty not responding to me right away. I have historically been an over thinker so when my own texts go a while without an answer I’ll over think them. I assume they might feel that too so I’ll feel bad if I do this. Another aspect is that I feel on some level that I’m being dishonest somehow and tricking them into being attracted to me and that if they knew the real me, an anxious mess inside, they wouldn’t be. So I feel guilty just by being with someone. I’m not actually doing anything dishonest, not lying. But my self criticism tells me this is my fault for some reason. That I’m doing something wrong somehow. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has felt this in any context and what has seemed to help move passed these feelings of guilt",Anxiety

I don’t know if anyone else gets this but when I got anxiety I had this weird fear about food. I was convinced If I was going to eat peanut butter I’d end up having an anaphylactic reaction and die. The only problem is that I’m actually not allergic to anything. My brain convinced myself though I had serious food allergies. Thanks brain! 

Anyway a few days ago I bought some peanut butter and even though I was terrified I ate it. Not going to lie, my anxiety was pretty high but I did it. I finally had peanut butter after 5 long years and it tasted soooooo good.

1687,t3_dh9y8x,I'm so proud just because I went to dinner,"I've had a severe to mild case of agoraphobia (was severe, now mild) for about 2 years. Since I'm homeschooled, at one point I think I didn't leave the house for weeks.

But I've been trying recently. Yesterday, my mum needed her tires changed. Which meant not only was it about a 40-50 minute drive from home, but we got a rental car and had 2 hours to waste. I was so nervous because it was some unfamiliar car, way bigger than ours, and we wouldn't be able to go home if I got upset. So we went to the mall, ate dinner (I get sick 99% of the time from restaurants so it's a sort of phobia) and then got our car and went home. All in all, like a 4-5 hour trip.

1688,t3_dhhumu,Anxiety sent me to the ER...twice,"Long story short, as short as I can make it.

I have a very long history with anxiety and depression (and personally, I believe they stem from untreated ADHD, but with my symptoms so severe, I can’t really get that seen to at the moment). Nobody really noticed aside from “Well she certainly is a very sensitive child/teen”.

In college it came to a head the first time when I started failing all of my classes, in subjects I’d previously done well in. I couldn’t keep up and felt like I was drowning. I went to the school mental health services and got prescribed an antidepressant, but it was too little, too late. I ended up dropping out of college.

Fast forward about eight years later: I’m stuck in a rut, my condition is worse than ever and I keep stubbornly ignoring the depth of it. I go to to talk therapy and agree to try out a variety of medications, none of which I stick with long for various reasons. I try college again but end up dropping out before the first semester ends.

I am let go from my job of five years, a job which I did not enjoy, but one which paid very well, took care of my healthcare needs, and supplied me with a social output. 

Since then I’ve picked up a minimum wage job that takes little effort, but I’m stressed constantly over the fact that I’m now 30, have been struggling with the same issues for over ten years, with no hope of feeling better, I have failed at everything I tried to accomplish, and adding to that...

For the last few months, I have felt sicker and sicker. Constant headaches. Heart palpitations round the clock. Keeping food down becomes a struggle and my appetite is less and less.

Then one day I’m at work closing up shop for the night. We’re literally about ten minutes from being done and I feel this burning hot flash run up and down my body. My arms becomes so weak I can’t lift a stack of paper. I crouch down behind the register until the feeling passes, then call an Uber to take me home because I feel like if I take the bus i’ll get sick on in (I’ve indeed gotten sick on the bus a few times before — not fun.) 

Once I get home I lay in bed still fully-clothed hoping my racing heart will calm down. Distantly, I realize I haven’t had enough to eat today, and maybe if I can just get a banana or a piece of toast I will feel better. But just getting up makes my heart jump and jive like it’s doing a long distance marathon. I’m incredibly dizzy and thirsty. In my attempt to go downstairs, I black out briefly. I manage to choke down half a banana and then lie there, waiting for my heart to calm down. It doesn’t, it seems only to beat harder and harder. I realize I’ve been lying there for hours, waiting to feel better. Suddenly I am panicking — what if I’m dying? What if something is seriously wrong with me? What if my heart is just going to go crazy til it stops? I call 911 and describe my symptoms. I’m so short of breath I can barely talk with the operator. 

She sends an ambulance. Within minutes my house is full of paramedics, talking my blood pressure and heartbeat and insulin levels. All normal, they say. My heart sounds perfectly healthy. They ask if I want to go to the hospital. At this point I’m having a full on panic attack (Oh god, I’m wasting these EMTs’ time, nothing is wrong with me, but then why do I still feel like I’m dying??) but I say yes. I’m home alone and the thought of them leaving me alone with my fear and panic has me spiraling harder. 

In the ambulance a man gives me pills for nausea and anxiety. It’s about midnight by now, and I get shown to a bed right away, where they take an EKG and draw some blood. Later I pee in a cup. It takes hours, but all the results come back normal. 

“It’s most likely just anxiety,” the doctor says. I want to scream. Of course I’m anxious — I’m always anxious. But I manage! I don’t pass out and I don’t usually throw up all my food! Surely something else is wrong? Surely i have — I don’t know? Diabetes, a serious heart condition?

There’s nothing more the ER can do then send me home with a referral to a PCD. At the time I didn’t have health insurance ( I now do) so I didn’t follow up. I just felt foolish, going to the ER for “no reason”

For a few days everything was normal, but then it happened again. I went to urgent care this time, where they told me it was gastroenteritis. I couldn’t keep anything down that wasn’t broth or water for a week. I lost over five pounds, and was already underweight to begin with. 

This whole time, my heart beat loudly and constantly in my chest, feeling like a bell telling me I was going to die. My body felt like it was giving up. I couldn’t eat. Even water made me sick. Standing up made me dizzy, trying to move around like a normal person had my chest clench in pain. I started logging my food intake and toilet schedule during all this. It didn’t look normal. 

I ended up missing work again, enough days that I needed another doctor’s note to prove I was really sick. I had since gotten accepted for Medicaid and made an appointment for a PCD but it was nearly a month away. I asked my mother to drive me to the urgent care but she, who was so freaked out over my behavior, took me to the ER instead. 

After learning I’d been there before, the doctors seemed to take me more seriously and were at least more thorough in their tests. They were very kind and explained that all they could do here was prove I was not dying, which all the EKGs and bloodwork proved I was not. I was given a short-term prescription for Ativan, and they talked about how when anxiety is untreated for so long it can manifest as physical symptoms, and the Ativan should at least help make those livable. I am still waiting to establish a relationship with my PCD to explore possible other chronic conditions ( I suspect I’ve been malnourished for a long time, and I suspect it’s to do something with a problem with my gut health, but these are just guesses). 

The Ativan doesn’t make me feel better. It does make it easier to get up and try to get on with life, despite still feeling that nausea and racing heart beat. It makes it easier to tell myself I’m not doing to get sick and die. 

I don’t really have a point in sharing all this other than, I suspect I’m not the only one who has gone through this, and to show that anxiety is a serious condition that has serious effects. 

My hope is that the doctor I meet is kind and willing to work with me to find a long term answer, and that I can also find some combination of therapy/medication to deal with the anxiety directly.

So...if you’ve ever been sick like I have, throwing up, unable to eat, and been told “you’re just anxious”....I know how you feel. It’s real, and it’s scary, and it’s not “just in your head”",Anxiety

I went to the ER immediately and they did a couple of tests and run some blood checks. All came back normal.


Now from now and then during the day for long periods of time (maybe 4 to 5, sometimes all day long) I've been feeling this constant pain/more like heaviness on the center of my chest. Also my hands have began sweating too.

1690,t3_dhkarv,I’m really angry right now and I don’t want to be.,"Long story short, I’m really tired and I’ve had a hella awful week at work. 

I moved back in with my parents and I brought my really neat pets with me. I actually really love it, I love my parents and I love being home again. I attempted suicide two and a half years ago. I had all these beliefs about myself and the world that I don’t have anymore, not to the degree they effected me. 

But sometimes I still struggle. And right now is one of those times. 

During my worst, I struggled with paranoia. A lot of my anxiety is from my dogs and my cat. I just want them to be okay forever. I love them so much. To the point where I make their food for them myself, just so I know what goes in them. I need to have control. It took a lot of trust to be able to feel safe with my dogs living here, with my family. 

They’re amazing and wonderful. But it is so hard to trust anyone with my pets. So hard! It’s hard to trust them not to leave the door open, or have xylitol gum, or remember to leave the burner off. But they’ve done okay.

But today was hard. My mom is staying at a family friend’s house, watching some kids. They came over today so my mom could do some things. I didn’t know this, I was at work all day (it’s been a very, very draining week. I have no days off, we’re short three people on a six person retail team for a small but very busy store. I think this is part of the reason I’m so irritated.) 

I came home and they were gone, but one of my dogs was throwing up everywhere. I called my mom and asked, and it turned out that one of the kids had left food down and he got to it. 

I was annoyed and I started ranting to my dad, who fed into it (because he too was annoyed with my mom) about how the kids had left the door open. Two of my dogs and my (indoor only) cat had ran out. He and my brother had to catch them. 

Now I am even more angry and I don’t feel safe leaving my pets here when I go to work, but it isn’t realistic for me to take three huge dogs and a Maine coon to work with me tomorrow. I am contemplating calling in sick, which is the last fucking thing my team needs. But I just don’t know what to do. I want to call at my mom and scream at her, but I am not that person anymore. I don’t want my anxiety to translate into anger. But I really, really just want to destroy something and just be angry. 

I don’t know if anyone will actually read all of this or whatever, and I know it’s really long. I think I just needed to rant. I have a lot of emotions right now and I don’t know what to do with them. My mom already, without a doubt, knew she really messed up, and I know she had told my family not to tell me what happened because it was pointless and it would only make me upset. But I am upset. I wish my dad didn’t feed into my anxiety by telling me that.

I thought those feelings were normal, until this past year when I started having panic attacks when out at the store. Things got way worst this summer when it started happening daily, multiple times a day. I was worried I was having blood sugar issues or another illness. Got checked out by my gp and ended up being referred to a psychologist. 

My anxiety is super physical. I’ll get shaky, sometimes I feel hungry, my heart races, I get the urge to have a bm, I pace a lot and lately I’ve been crying uncontrollably. Sometimes it gets so intense I have a hard time believing it’s “just anxiety”. But if it was something else, it wouldn’t go away just by preparing food.

I’m at the point now that because these symptoms have been so intense for so long that when I’m not shaking or when my heart beats normally, that something is wrong and something bad will happen.

I made a lot of changes to my eating habits and CBT therapy seemed to help. At this point, medication isn’t considered by feat that the side effects would trigger panic attacks.

But these past 3 days have just been awful. I feel like I’ve undone all the progress that I’ve made.  I’ve slept maybe 3-4 hours a night, waking up frequently, shaking. The days have been the same, filled with shaking, racing heart, crying, crying and more crying and just feeling not right. It’s been hard to get out of bed.

on the way there i put on a podcast i like to try to calm down. at one point my bf brakes really hard to avoid hitting a biker, a similar thing had happened while we were driving to get here so i freaked out and started crying cause it was the 2nd time that day i thought we were going to crash. (i am already stupidly overly sensitive to this stuff cause i got in a bad accident and my car was totaled about 6 months ago). 

so i freaked out and cried and screamed and started getting overly sensory mindful. i have aspergers which is stupid and my bf was getting annoyed that i kept covering my ears when he was talking to me bc it sounded very loud. now he got fast food and we’re back at the room in bed and i ruined one of our 2 nights we’re here just because i’m stupid and sensitive and useless and i feel like shit in a way i haven’t in a long time. i’m in a spiral where i already ruined our time so there’s no recovering and i feel like such an asshole. it’s hard when these things happen to get back to normal and i’m not sure how to recover or make it up to him.",Anxiety

I feel trapped in a cycle of self-sabotage and being forever alone with my own delusional emotions. There is so much that I want to do with my life, and my SICK BRAIN is holding me back like a prisoner. My self-esteem is so low, I can't believe in myself in absolutely any aspect of life. I don't believe in my abilities in my career. I don't have enough confidence in myself maintain the effort that friendships require, so I have no friends. They always fizzle out. I have no luck with relationships because I had a young, traumatically abusive one that led to PTSD and I have never been able to be functional romantically since. I am too insecure and needy of constant validation and reassurance, because of my abuse and subsequent low self-esteem. This makes me exhausting to others.

My own interests are completely neglected because I don't have the energy to focus on anything other than survival. Every day, I push past immense physiological anxiety that manifests as adrenaline, fight or flight responses. I feel that I am doomed to repeat the mistakes of my past on repeat and never truly learn from them enough to change myself for good.

I am spiraling into a pit of despair, and every obstacle I encounter is like a knock even further into the abyss. Instead of viewing the obstacles that challenge my strength as opportunities for growth, each adverse experience is like a trauma. It weakens my self-esteem and resolve to overcome. I am being buried by the stress of life and it won't slow down to let me catch up and dig myself out. I am paralyzed with fear of any more traumas, but I am equally paralyzed by the fear of staying still where I am, because it is the last place I want to be. Help.",Anxiety

1713,t3_dhiswm,"Anyone else have trouble with concocting unlikely, anxiety-inducing scenarios?","Logically, I often know the situations I’m creating in my mind are unlikely, yet even when I rationally explain that to myself, the anxiety itself keeps bubbling up around that made-up scenario in a way that consumes my thoughts.

For example, I recently had a friend over to my condo. They left in front of me and presumably closed the door (I don’t recall closing the door myself). After they left, I rushed to use my restroom (lol) but as I came back to the main living/kitchen area where the door was, I was plagued by the thought that WHAT IF the door had been slightly ajar? 

Now logically, that seems unlikely as the door was shut when I came back from the bathroom. And naturally, if I were standing right there as they left, if they hadn’t shut it, wouldn’t I have closed it out of habit? And even if it HAD been open for 1 minute, what would/could possibly have happened in that time, anyway?

1717,t3_dhi8g7,"This is sooo long, and I am sooo sorry, but there's tl;dr and questions, at least!","**Tl;dr** – I think my dad’s news of cancer is what triggered my first 3 panic attacks, and I’m worried it’s going to happen again at work, like it did the 3rd time, and in front of a supervisor, and I couldn’t stop it while it was happening, regardless of trying to realize it was all in my head and I had nothing to worry about as soon as it started, but it didn’t stop.

Help me figure out ways to not let that from happening again, as an always-anxious person? And if it happens, how the fuck do I stop it asap, so they don’t let me go (they can still let me go for “no reason” for three more months since I’m new there)?

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s why I think it’s related to my dad, since I don’t think I’ve ever had panic attacks before. He was recently diagnosed for his second time with cancer after being cancer free for a few years, and feeling good:

* 10/4, he told me where the cancer was.
   * the next morning I woke up with incredible anxiety. My friend was coming over for us to go to the corn maze, and I felt fucking weird as hell, like I was really high on a drug that I was not enjoying in any way, and my heart was racing, my body tingled, my peripheral vision was dark and vision blotchy, my body was shaky, and I couldn’t speak properly. I had no idea what was going on. I told him I was just feeling weird, and then I watered my plants and scooped the kitty litter, which, didn’t need to be done at that time since we were supposed to be heading to the corn maze. I tried to keep quiet in the car ride until I calmed down. I had no reason to be that anxious around him, or the activity we were about to do. 
* \-10/7, I asked him through text what treatments he needed and he said he’s waiting to get a call to get an appointment.
   * I told him that is frustrating because I felt like he should be getting treatment ASAP. 
   * Two hours later, after a meeting ended at work, I had my 2nd attack. I wrote down my symptoms, and asked my dad if I could call him later to “talk about how weird I feel from anxiety” during my lunch. I left my building for lunch, called him, and immediately started crying as I talk to him about my anxiety because I had no freaking idea what the hell was going on (didn’t even cross my mind that these were attacks). He asked a ton of questions. Asked if I could walk properly, what meds/supplements I was taking, etc., neither of us knew what caused it and it was really disconcerting. He told me to stop my supplements (I knew that wasn’t the issue, but I told him I would, and I did).
   * Talking to him helped, and after lunch, I went back in and felt a bit better. 
* 10/10, I sent him a text, and he texted me back saying “Ok. Can’t handle this now. Problems with insurance paying for my tests”
   * in the afternoon I asked if everything worked out and he said he’d find out tomorrow. THIS WAS SO FRUSTRATING TO ME! He needs treatment ASAP! I hate how long it’s taking now that they KNOW he has cancer. It’s been almost 3 fucking weeks. 
   * the next day on Friday, is when that attack in front of the supervisor happened.

&amp;#x200B;

So. I've had general and social anxiety (and depression) my entire life (both thanks to my dad's genes, although my dad has only had attacks years ago and doesn't have general or social, but I had never known about his attacks until I described my second one). At doctor's, whenever asked if I've ever had an attack. I have said, ""no"", because I couldn't think of a time where it got really severe. I do remember trembling when highly anxious, but not the other symptoms. I'm just anxious every second I am not in my own space (I consider anxiety different than being stressed in my own space), and it heightens when I talk to people, and within the past year or two, It's gotten to a point where I screw up my words, mix them up, or say a word that I wasn't intending to just use, like someone else said it for me. But no trembling.

I had realized at that time, that the way my body handles anxiety seems to change every few years. Does this happen to anyone else? Is there possibly a scientific reason for it?

I'll give the short version (most-recent attack) here and give the longer version (1st and 2nd) in a comment.

Okay! So, let's get started. I already didn't mean for this to be long. You know what, fuck it. It's going to be long. But. I'll still put the other two in the comments. I feel like society should let texting to each other while sitting next to each other or across from each other to communicate should be acceptable. Who fucking agrees? Why hasn't this been a thing yet? Whenever I think of that, some movie pops into my head and I can't remember what, but it's something with time travel I think, and there's a scene where it looks sort of like tokyo with bright cities and there's a girl in it, and I think she stops running, and looks back? I don't know, but there's future cell phone thing involved. I think. But yeah, for whatever reason, that scene (probably a lot reimagined) comes up in my head whenever I talk about texting instead of chatting). Whatever. Moving along.

Okay, let's *really* get started. I am at work, and it is Friday, the 11th. We are on a flex (off every other Friday) schedule, so half the group isn’t there, and unfortunately, that means my close coworker friend whom is def my coworker-bffl) isn’t there, and it would have helped out a lot if he was…

A ‘lead’ *quap* (just a step above me in terms of job title) told another lead, *wug* ask me if I wanted to go in the field with her to do some stuff and I declined. Told her I was working on something (semi) important on the computer and that I dressed for the office. I did not want to deal with coworker *wug.* I knew she didn’t want me there, and only asked because *quap* told her to, and *quap* is a little more superior than her, since she’s been there longer.

Well after an hour or two, *quap* wanted a coworker that’s my equal to do some driving to also do some field work that would be super beneficial to have a second person along, and then she asked if I wanted to go. I told them I had to work on that (semi) important thing (which she was well-aware of that it was not critical to get done before Monday, but she didn’t say anything. And that was that…). I really wanted to go! I wanted to get out of the fucking office, away from the computer! My job is mostly field work, but sometimes we get stuck having office days. This was a great opportunity, cause I like this guy. Everyone else is super friendly and funny except for wug.. When *quap* left, prob for the bathroom or something, I went up to my equal, and asked if he as okay going alone. He said he’d prefer to have someone with him, because it would make things a shit-ton easier, and I told him I did want to go out with him because I can’t stare at my screen all day! but, the main reason I declined was because I had already declined *wug*, and if she came back, and saw I was gone, then she’d be really upset and I didn’t want to fuck things up even more. And by this, I mean, she has something against me, I have no idea exactly what, and it’s not like, a personal thing, it’s a work thing. She will have nice convos with me, but when it comes to going out in the field, she doesn’t fucking want me, she wants my bffl, because he does ALL the work, and she gets to stay in the truck, and he’s also really fucking fast. If she works with me, then she will have to do some of the work, and I’m going to be slower than bffl, and she already called me slow my first fucking month in. CHRIST, I’m fucking learning still, give me a break. And of course I’m going to be slower than all the other men that she’s comparing me to. I should have told her to try to do what I was doing and see if she could do it any faster. Except, I was done by the time she called me slow. I think that’s what she’s got against me. But, she treats everyone like shit when we are actually in the field, or in the office, she delegates tasks, and then after they’re done, tells them to do something totally different because she changed her mind, and they just spend hours researching all for fucking nothing. She also is just really rude all together when it comes to work. She is very difficult to deal with.

He said some words of understanding, since he knows what’s been going on, and every fucking one of my 3 other equals have issues with her. I said more words of apologizes and reiterating that I really didn’t want to make things worse with *wug* (and of course I was nervous even saying that out of guilt for not going with him, so I fucked up those words, but he understood). I am pretty sure everyone thinks I am an idiot at work because I fuck up my words a lot.

Honestly. I just needed to say, ‘rock the boat’. But I’m terrible at verbal words when face-to-face.

Anyway, he left. *quap* was still gone. I was about to take lunch, but spent about 10 more min at my computer. When I was going to grab my lunch from the fridge. I saw that *quap* and *equal* were talking to *supervisor* (I have two) about what their plans were. I was glad they were distracting him so I could get my lunch in the fridge over there without him having to say any words to me.

I realized they were telling them their plan to send *equal* out alone and were telling him that I was staying at my computer, which of course, made me sound lazy and uninterested in working. I walked by a few minutes later, to see if they left, and they did, so I went over to *supervisor*, I was already anxious going over there to talk to him. I said to him, the main reason I didn’t go…. Is because *wug* originally asked me out and I declined, telling her I had that important thing to do, and I didn’t want her to come back and see I was gone and things get worse because things already aren’t that great \[and then the tingles hit and everything creeps in real fucking fast, but I thought I could continue before it’s too late\]. And then he inquired about that. But that was the end of my “regular” self… I started fucking up my words when I was replying to him, he asked if I was okay. I told him I was. I don’t know if it was something physical he notice, or the way I was speaking (I was wondering this while we were still talking). I might ask him what he noticed. Maybe my eyes were jiggling because the whole rest of my body was trembling? Dunno! Awkward, though! Or he just noticed I was fucking up my words more when I wasn’t before. Regardless. I don’t remember any words that were said between us when once he wanted to know more. Except that I remember feeling like he was asking too many questions and I felt weird giving him answers and I am pretty sure I tried to give him “soft” answers and not tell him everything. It’s a weird dynamic going on. I guess part of all of our selves don’t want to get her fired, but, also, things would be so much better if she was.

Anyway, at the end of the conversation. I told *supervisor*, ‘sorry. I’m having a panic attack.’ I meant to say ‘anxiety attack’ because I feel it’s more appropriate to call it anxiety rather than panic, but, of course, the word came out incorrectly, as in, not the word I had intended to say, as it does when I’m in that state. At least I was able to say that sentence without fucking up how I spoke, like, the word order, like I often do, also during situations like those.

He, as a very empathetic guy, looked concerned, guessed it was probably because we were talking about *wug*, and asked if I wanted to go to one of the empty meeting rooms. I told him it was fine, and that I was about to take lunch. He told me he will discuss this with *othersupervisor* and the three of us will get together and talk about it. I said, okay… dreading every single word in that sentence. Before I walked away, apologized again.

Okay, so I need help: I had no idea it was a “panic attack”, but those words just came out of my mouth before I could even think of them. It was, absolutely, incredibly, embarrassing. I know *supervisor* empathetic, but, I honestly don’t think he’s had any experience with anyone with anxiety. So, it may concern him. Also, I am worried this might give them a reason to let me go, because *wug* and I aren’t getting along (I will have to fucking clarify, if I fucking can), and they want someone that can get along with everyone and not be a risk of safety when out in the field if I have another panic attack. I mean, I was functional, so, I hope they don’t think that I’d be a safety risk. I’ve never gotten very anxious in the field.

It’s like, an out-of-body experience, but whenever I try to google something, it always comes up for depersonalization and derealization, and, it’s neither of those! This, this is sort of like criticizing a movie. For example, I’ll be sitting a certain way, and then move (I sit in a lot of positions), and then see myself doing that move again. It’s like I am above myself, looking at my body, doing that movement again, and judging to make sure it wasn’t a bad movement to make, I think about how that might look, and if it was a weird move to make, and then get anxious that maybe it was, and maybe that person I’m talking to thought it was weird, and that they’re also noticing I’m not even paying attention to them right now because I am too focused on what I just did, so I tell myself to listen, and then I listen, and try to hear and take it what they’re saying. This also happens just at my desk. I will put my water bottle down, and then see myself, from above, doing that again, trying to figure out if I did it in an okay-way (not too loud, not close to the edge).The entire time, with tingling in the body, like tiny dull needles poking me everywhere. This was post full-on attack. I never felt good about my actions, I just felt like they were “okay” and not going to make me look weird.

I cannot remember the other two, because I didn’t realize what they were, and they weren’t as severe/embarrassing, since I was with someone I knew for the first one, and basically alone (at my desk) for the second one). The thing is, I can tell myself there’s nothing to worry about, like, hey, he’s a nice guy, he’s not going to hurt you or say anything mean, but I know conversation will happen and unknown things that I have to interact with is what makes me anxious. I don’t want to feel like an idiot.

My fear: I am going to get an attack the moment I step in the room with the two supervisors, and it will be 100% awful, and I won’t know what to do. I did a looooot of reading on how to stop a panic attack, and most of them haven’t worked while I’m even alone, and most of them require me to be alone. I will need something \*on the spot\* to ease it. I wish there was like an injection, where once it happens, I can just jab myself with a needle, and then be back to “normal”. Are there any meds that can do that? I don’t think anything is *that* fast acting.

**Questions:**

the way my body handles anxiety seems to change every few years. Does this happen to anyone else? Is there possibly a scientific reason for it?

Think it’s okay to write down what to say beforehand, like, little bullets, so that I remember to say them during a meeting that I will absolutely not be able to speak well in, regardless if I feel “normal” or not, because my “normal/baseline” is still more anxious than with coworkers, with supervisors, but not high enough for attack? My supervisor looks down at a piece of paper when we are in meetings to remind herself of what topics she and I need to cover, so I think it’s fair game? I know I will still fuck up my words.

Does/has anyone else, while anxious fuck up the order of their words, not know the right word to say, or say a different word that you meant to say, and get anxious while doing that, so it makes you even more anxious? Have you been able to ease the frequency of it?

What are your methods to ease a panic attack? What if you’re talking to someone while it’s happening? How do you stop one when you know when one is coming on?

Does anyone else feel the way I do about the out-of-body where you’re actually looking at your own body from above, doing the action you just did, to see if it was the right action to make?

While trying to calm myself down while super anxious, I would tell myself funny things that happened in the past, next weekend is something to look forward to, my kitty, and the fact that at that moment, I had absolutely nothing to be anxious about, and it’s all in my head, so why can’t my body stop feeling that way?

1718,t3_dhi4s5,post graduation anxiety,"Hey all!

So now I've graduated I think my anxiety moves from fretting over relationships and guys, to jobs and work life. I have been unemployed since my graduation in July. I had to move countries after my graduation so that was a huge effort and now I'm back in my parents house which of course does make things worse and better at the same time. 

I am 25 and never had a ""real"" job. Sideline jobs, summer jobs, internships yes. But I feel pierced with self doubt such as ""why should anyone hire you? they're gonna kick you out immediately"". Which doesn't make sense because so far I've performed pretty good (not perfect or over achievingly good). However I noticed I would rather just opt out of this anxiety game by just applying to random jobs without qualification needed. Weirdly enough my dream has been to do my PhD and then become a professor or something like that. But I studied a very specialized master in art history and the field has basically zero money for young graduates (you have to finance yourself which I am not able at all). 

So here I am. Afraid of getting a real job, like full time, just living and making money with some good work in a good firm (usually it would be museum work or at an art institute or something like that). But my head or anxiety tells me that if I'm afraid of getting a job I will never get one. is that true? of course not, it's the anxiety being anxious about anxiety itself. 

What should I do? How have you overcome this? Am I really doomed for having anxiety and therefore will never get a job? 

 I am seriously very afraid of those sayings a girl told me this year ""your worst fears will come true, you create your own reality"". That would be the horror and with a generalized anxiety disorder this would mean my whole life would be a nightmare 24/7 for the rest of my life. What if I'm really creating my unemployment reality with my anxiety and fears and how can overcome this?

1725,t3_dhh7wg,Anyone here prescribed benzodiazepines daily? What meds are you taking for your anxiety?,"I’ve been taking gabapentin daily for my generalized anxiety for about 6 months now. It was working wonderfully at first, but life has gotten extremely stressful over the last few months and I’ve been suffering 1-3 full blown panic attacks per week. They’re extremely intense. The first time, my fiancé took me to the hospital because we were certain I was having a heart attack.

I get so dizzy and disoriented that I fall to the ground and can’t walk for up to an hour. I get violent tremors throughout my entire body including my head. The world feels like it’s spinning around me a million times faster and I can’t get a full inhale of air and have shallow rapid breathing for 30-60 min. My hands, arms, and head start stinging and tingling and the entire time I just want to scream out in terror but I struggle to vocalize anything. It feels like the strongest man in the world has his hands on my chest and is slowly adding pressure and trying to crush the life out of me. I genuinely feel like I’m dying. They render me useless for the rest of the day and it’s interfering with my ability to do my job or manage my life. I had one this morning and haven’t been able to leave bed all day.

The other problem is that I’m losing my health insurance at the end of November as I’m getting laid off this coming Friday. If this weren’t the case, I would ask my psychiatrist to prescribe me 5-10 benzos for just the panic attacks. I never ever want to take that stuff daily because it absolutely terrifies me. My old boss went through Xanax withdrawal and I never want to put myself through that.

But since I’m losing my health insurance, I’m thinking about asking for a full 30 day script. Is that something my psychiatrist can even do? I’m really scared about having no options when I’m uninsured. Anyone have any insight? I’m sorry for the frantic data dump and countless questions, I am just really desperate here.

tl;dr My girlfriend was my mechanism of coping with my problems but she wasn’t ready for a relationship and broke up with me. Now I have no way to cope except the self harm I’ve relapsed to and pre existing problems

#full
Last year in early February I was dealing with catastrophic thoughts and depression because I was afraid that my parents were getting a divorce because of me, my older brother’s autism causes him to be abusive, my best friend had died of a heart disease, and my mom was in the hospital (she was pregnant but i didn’t know). 

To combat this I resorted to self harm. I did it because the endorphins released made me really happy as long as I did it periodically. When my doctor found out my parents sent me to a mental hospital so on and so on. 

When I got out a new exchanged student named Brooklyn helped me with my problems. I can’t ever explain what separated her from others but she made my problems feel like nothing. Every second with her was bliss and she was gorgeous aswell.

4 months ago I had asked her out after we spent our summer together and she said yes. The entire time with Brooklyn, she would help me resist my urges to cut and suicidal thoughts.

3 days ago, however, she broke up with me. She said that she couldn’t handle a relationship and felt really guilty because she was shutting me out and that she didn’t want me self harming because she was being distant. Ever since, I’ve cut my arms over 30 times. What makes things hard is that I’m in marching band and have come so close to being caught by my directors, my friends have found out.

I’m trying to get better. She says she wants to be friends with me, but only if I can be around her without breaking down, but the mention of her name makes me breakdown and a cut appears on my body. 

I just want to get over the breakup and find a new way to cope with my problems. Please help me.",Anxiety
1729,t3_dhglbe,I feel like I’m losing it,"14 days and some hours ago I quit smoking cold turkey. Which is great except my anxiety and hypocondriasis has gone through the roof, impacting myself and the people around me. 

Essentially, since I was 11 or so I’ve had that ‘air hunger’ type problem where every minute or so I feel the urge to take a big, deep breath. If I deny it then my body forces a yawn. It’s annoying but I’ve learned to live with it. I don’t think it’s “shortness of breath” because it’s not like I’m out of breath or need to catch my breath. It’s really just a habit- every minute or so I fill my lungs up completely and it feels good. If I’m distracted I don’t really do it as much. 

Anyway, since I quit smoking I’ve for some reason convinced myself that this is due to COPD/emphysema. And it’s driving me crazy. I find myself re-reading the same handful of articles nonstop, every thought seems to be focused on my breathing. It got so bad a few days ago I left work and took the day curled up on my couch. 

It’s more under control now, but barely. I feel like I’m right on the edge of another day where I just can’t function.

However, I can't just treat this as a holiday. My ID card expired so I have to get a new one and just the thought of having to deal with bureaucracy makes me unable to sleep. I am not going to miss a whole lot of uni lectures but my mom decided to cut the internet off. So in order for me to catch up properly, I also have to deal with the broadband company and sign (and pay for) a new contract.

What is more, my mom's apartment is becoming almost uninhabitable. Her mom (my grandmother) not only passed away but the oven broke, the showerhead is falling apart, and the kitchen is infested with cockroaches. I've offered my mom to move in with me (we have a spare room) so she doesn't have to deal with terrible living conditions. She refused because she has more work to do and can't just leave.

I am now extremely worried. I see what my mom has to go through. But I don't know if I can help her enough. I offered to buy her a new oven and clean the house while I am here but her wage is way too low for her to support herself and pay off her predatory lenders. I am just a uni student who works part time washing dishes so I don't think I can help for long.

The uncertainty of the future is killing me and that's why I've been rolling in bed for the last couple of hours while my mom and our little kitty have been chilling.

I am having a really hard time getting her to establish healthy relationship communication with me like I've had in past relationships.

The brain zaps and physical symptoms seemed to have subsided finally a few days ago thank god. But I’m having anxiety and depression and I’m not sure if it’s still withdrawal, or if it’s just me. I just switched doctors, as my last one said withdrawal is no biggie and told me to start weaning while on my honeymoon...still so pissed about that. My new doc wrote me a script for Wellbutrin XL in case I feel like I want to get back on. From my brief conversation with her, she guesses I am probably a lifer on meds, but said if I want to give it more time I can.

I guess I’m hoping others out there could guide me in what to do. Do I give it more time to see if I get better, or should I start taking meds again? I feel miserable and my gut isn’t telling me what to do.",Anxiety

Its such a weird feeling too because it doesnt feel like im worried about anything than i get a heart palpitation and boom it all starts or ill be getting ready to fall asleep finally and just before i get there i get the feeling that something is wrong or a weird sensation etc. And at this point im starting to wonder if maybe something is wrong, like a premonition or something even though i know that sounds crazy but after hearing so many stories about that stuff it starts to get to me. ive tried to convince myself over and over that my only risk factor as a teen is being overweight but i just cant stop this feeling that my heart is failing even though both heart failure and heart attacks are rarely fatal but then it goes to brain tumor or stroke or aneurysm which are fatal almost always. 

I just want to feel normal again, this all just started a month ago after moving from my grandmas who ive lived with my whole life to my dads which is a much better environment, if anything i should feel less stress not more.

There were some points where we made too much for government assistance but not enough to pay for everything we needed. I'm semi-independent now (in college, music ed) and basically live on my own during the school year. 

My plan was to work during the summer to earn money for books and anything else I needed, but that plan is falling short. My savings are much lower than I want them to be, and I'm worried I don't have enough for books next semester. Just yesterday, I got a text from someone in my section about the costs of a hotel room. For the two nights we're staying, it'll be $70, and after figuring that out I basically had a panic attack. One of my best friends was there when I read that, and he offered to help out and give me some money, but I just can't accept it.

I read a quote online which stated that the only way to defeat your fear is to face it. I then decided that I will go to homecoming and stand in the most crowded spot for 30 minutes. It was tough and the first 15 minutes I awkwardly stood there while people around me were dancing and jumping to music. I then realized that I sent my self into a downwards spiral because me being awkward made me anxious and me being anxious made me awkward. I then began jumping to the music and for the first time did not feel anxious in a crowd but embraced that I was part of it. I stayed in the crowd for much longer than 30 minutes and enjoyed it.  It is possible to get over social anxiety, just find the opportunity to make yourself socially anxious and FACE IT.",Anxiety

I was down to meeting new people, so I agreed. Fast forward to about a month ago. Many of times people had left the group chat out of anger (fights happening between people in the chat) and everyone always goes to them and tries to make them feel better and get them to come back. At one point, I did this. No one DM’d me, no one tried adding me back. Finally I had to ask one of them if I could come back. When I did I see that the first thing said after I had left was “lmao get nae naed”. Then soon after they said how I always choose the wrong side in fights. That conversation was between a girl who was in 100% of the fights had, and a guy who liked her. Now, since I have anxiety, I think that they are doing something. Every once and a while, it would say that I am the only one online, then out of nowhere 5 out of the 10 of us just go online, and don’t message the chat we are in. I feel like they have another chat where they say things about me, because they talk behind people’s backs a lot, which technically I am doing now too. Just recently I saw a post on r/teenagers and it was talking about a guy who discovered his friends did in fact have a secret group chat just to make fun of him.

1786,t3_dh5lo6,"I'm so anxious my boyfriend will propose in 2 weeks. I'm so hopeful about it but so anxious it wont happen, and I cant ask him about it point blank","My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and some months now. And about a year ago we had some hypothetical ""when we get married"" kinds of conversations. Then 6 months ago he started saying stuff like ""what jewels do you like?"" And ""You said you're allergic to nickle...so I take it you couldnt wear a ring?"" And my mind instantly jumped to the *is he trying to probe me on proposal / engagement questions*

We've talked about it and we want to be engaged for at least 1 year before marriage.  And we both want to get married on our dating anniversary (august 23rd) so we wouldn't have to remember a new date. 

Right before august 23rd this year, he told me ""so...I didnt get anything. I just havent had the money"". Which I totally understand, and I didnt think anything twice of it at all. We are both working adults who are still trying to save money up for important stuff--he wants a newer reliable car and I need to pay off 800$ credit card and 18k student loan debt.

Fast forward to 1 week ago. He asks about my openness to going to a brand new restaurant in downtown in our city, it's like a bar and also candy shop?. Think cheesecake factory kind of price.. and to give you perspective--the fanciest place we have been is olive garden / longhorns. (And this place had table napkins...so it must be really pricey!!).

so after its mentioned that the place has cookie flavored alcohol and lots of sweets (which I am an absolute FIEND for just a fun fact) I went *hell yeah that sounds awesome!*

Then my romantic mind went *Wait. New restaurant..table cloths, those are are kind of fancy....high price? Is he... proposing? Nooo!.... but you dont normally take your long term SO to a high end place Especially after last month when he was saying that we shouldnt do take out every week because it's expensive.. hm...*

Then a few days later he asks ""would you want to get a hotel room somewhere in the city for the night?"" And when I asked why, he lives in a house. and he said plainly ""because I have roommates.""

And that really got me thinking: *no one takes their SO to a hotel for the night if the roommates dont mind hearing others bone, especially If its ""just a date""....so either something special is bound to happen......or he reeeally wants to bang a lot.*

But he has been saying stuff like ""when we get married"" for the past week... like not in a hypothetical ""when we get married"" way but a ""realistically speaking,  when we get married."" Way

And I've been ruminating on this for 2 or 3 days now. And I'm worried sick that my overly-romantic-and-mushy mind has jumped to conclusions...and jumping to conclusions is a worst case scenario I hope. I really want it to happen, to the point where if It didnt happen and i say I'm not disappointed....Then I'd be straight up lying. If it didnt happen...I would probably be crushed.

But I really want it to happen. I've wanted it for a few months now. But this really isnt the kind of thing to ask your partner. Thatd just be.....not really okay?, to be ruining any surprise or underlying thought of ""my SO will never expect this, as I have planned this for so long and worked hard to keep this secretive!""

I've been trying ask questions to try and probe any sort of remotely subtle answers. Like I've asked ""what should I wear? Evening dress for like cocktail dinners? Jeans, however well kempt, just dont sound right at a restaurant with table cloths..""

And his response is something so dumb! he goes """"it doesnt matter to me, whatever you like!"""" And I just want to bonk him on the head.

That doesnt give me any sort of assurance about whether my wardrobe is over the top! That doesnt give me any sort of idea of what to really expect (mainly sitting vs some sitting vs walking some). He may not even care about the dress thing....but I do.. I like looking all nice on any date. And if he does decide to ask..then that definetly is not any exception.

Like I've said...I **really** want this to happen. It would make it feel like reality to take the primary step towards marrying. I want it to be real...

But I cant ask him about this. But I feel like I need some give. I dont want to try my hopes up. What if it doesnt happen?.m I'll have gotten my hopes up. And i dont want that heartbreak over something that I ramped up in my head.

And I'm worried if the tables turn and he doesnt do it, so I end up asking or deciding to....then he'll be uncomfortable? Or at least try work out some kind of compromise. I know it's not who does it or how you do it that's special, but the fact that it does happen. I'm just real mushy like that I guess.

I've been on edge about all this since maybe tuesday evening /Wednesday morning. And its almost sunday now. I've been talking to coworkers about it all week, and everyone-- even the ones that dont really know him--are saying ""it sure sounds like it.""

**TLDR : I'm 75-80% sure my boyfriend will propose on the night of a really nice date in 2 weeks. I really want it to happen but I'm so worried that I'm overthinking this and it wont happen...and I'd be crushed if it didnt**",Anxiety

After about 30 mins my body began to shake and I lay down and woke up hours later completely lost and feeling really awful. I was told I'd basically overdosed on caffeine and it had made my adrenals over work and shut me down..  
I've since stayed clear of coffee and stick to teas and seem to be fine.

Today I ordered a decaf coffee and was accidentally given a regular coffee. I took maybe 2 sips only before the barista rushed over and explained it wasn't decaf and she had given me the wrong order. I initially joked, thinking it was impossible for me to be affected by such a small amount of caffeine from the coffee.

After about 30-40 mins my hands started to shake like crazy and my heart rate shot up and into an anxiety attack. I began crying and losing breath.

1791,t3_dgx4xf,Have anxiety/fear of death? My life changed for the better in 9 minutes.,"For many years I have had an anxiety/fear of death. Visions of death (not suicide, but it happening to me). All the what ifs. The insane panic. The intense thoughts. Most people would never know any of that about me. I believe there are several events in my life that have contributed to these feelings, the biggest of which is a 6x rollover car accident from which I somehow walked away nearly unscathed almost 20 years ago. 

I've seen a therapist several times over the years but nothing has really ultimately calmed these thoughts after all the time/work/money I put into it. There has been periods of intensity and periods where they die down, but I can say without doubt that I've never had such a rapid/positive change from something so simple.

A few weeks ago, my current therapist suggested I check out some of the ""Feeling Good Podcast"" by David D. Burns, a Stanford doctor. I came to the episode entitled *""018: Ask David — Overcoming the Fear of Death""* and gave it a listen, really hoping to take something valuable away. I was floored.

The episode runtime is only 11 minutes, quite short compared to many of this others. Some of that time is the intro and ending, but those other 9 or so minutes have *absolutely changed my life* and my perception/feelings about death. 

I don't want to summarize the episode, because what is said in it should be heard directly from the podcast, in part I think, because of how it is delivered. What he says is just so insanely logical and simple that I found, nearly instantly, that I can't deny it and it's like a switch was flipped inside my brain. 

I can't claim I'm completely cured yet, but I would say I have seen a 95%+ reduction in anxiety or thoughts about death in the last 9 days. I feel free. Give it a shot if you suffer or have suffered from the same and I hope it works for you.

Thanks for reading.

But on the way home, I started thinking about it again. And then I started remembering the wrecks I've had. I can imagine it all so clearly, it's like I'm there again, in the car, dazed and hurt. I can smell the almost sweet smell, see the fogginess of the air, hear the metal crunch against metal. The worst is hearing my own scream. And I was remembering all this (not for the first time, but tonight was bad) at a red light and tears welled up in my eyes, I thought I was going to scream or start sobbing, or both.

Unfortunately I got worse and worse over the last 2 weeks. I was constantly thinking about my condition and if these anxiety would ever leave for good. One doc said I have OCD another said it was just anxiety. They both did not take much time to ""diagnose"" me. I just don't know ""what"" I am  I reached the point today, where I was trapped in the deepest anxious state I've ever been into. My brain was racing, I couldn't barely move but also not hold still. I wanted to cry but couldn't. It fely like my mind was torn apart. I don't know if this was a panic attack, anxiety or what ever. It was the worst feeling I've ever felt. The feeling of eternal doom and deepest dread with eternal hopelessness would describe it the best I think. I had to take a walk for 30 minutes to get out of this state at least a little bit. There's no one I can talk to right now. I live alone ,my parents and friends don't understand. I just don't know what I do from here. I'm a depressive, oversensitive and anxious man who just wants to feel better. But it cannot take it anymore right now. Do you think I have any chance of recovering from this? I just want to live a life without anxiety and ruminating. Any help is really appreciated.",Anxiety

1804,t3_dh3pd7,Took a major L today.,"Today I had a full on mental breakdown. I was at work, and I felt panic coming on. That’s fine, it happens all the time. I usually use the dont run, don’t hide method. Today it just wasn’t working. Told my coworker i had to go for a walk, and I called my gf. Full panic attack kicks in. My gf is calming me down so I go back to work. It ramps up AGAIN and shows no sign of stopping. I left work and walked home half way, then broke into a full sprint. I couldn’t take what was happening in my mind.

I wasn’t having palpitations, it was all cerebral. Crazy thoughts, dizzy, thinking I’m on the verge of insanity. Couldn’t feel my limbs and just an overwhelming sense of terror. Got home and called my boss, told him everything. Called my
Coworker and apologized. I couldn’t stop panicking. I paced around my house and splashed water in my face for over an hour, trapped in an acute panic state. 

Eventually I passed out. Like really passed out. I think my brain just got overwhelmed with what was going on and shut down. I laid down on my bed, and lights out. I woke up and called my dad and said I can’t make it for thanksgiving tomorrow. I have three days off and just want to lay in bed. I haven’t slept in 5 days due to a skin rash, and I think that’s what tipped the scale.

This has never happened. Just last week I was making so much progress. I feel defeated, invalid, like I’ll never be able to go back to work or be a functional human being. I can’t go on living this way, but I’m too afraid to take medication and therapy gives me panic attacks. I don’t know what I’m going to do.",Anxiety

So, I got an amazing offer to kick start my career post graduation (I’m a senior in college) with an internship in Madrid!

My anxiety makes me feel completely trapped in a box and once I get one panic attack, I get one every single day for weeks. 

I want to take this amazing once in a lifetime opportunity but just so scared about the anxiety I might get.

1809,t3_dh7mls,Anxiety from a really tough decision.,"All yesterday and this morning I've been suffering from heart attack symptoms and numbness plus nausea, I ended a budding relationship last night due to trust issues I have from a previous relationship. I didn't realise how bad I had it until my feelings developed for this person and my mind would constantly race and I'd become convinced she was betraying me.

I was open with my issues with them because we always wanted to help each other through everything but just sharing them was very upsetting for them which I can understand, I already felt guilty and shameful for these thoughts so seeing them get upset made it a lot worse.

I always tried to just share my thoughts but this person always seemed to see them as accusations and not just me sharing these ridiculous thoughts I'm having, maybe I could have worded them better.

It was making me completely miserable, it's really unhealthy for a relationship and I'm just happy I decided to walk away before I acted on these thoughts and became controlling because the thought of being like that sickens me.

I'm going to pursue therapy for these trust issues because I can't be in any kind of relationship with this mind set.

It's just a shame because she was everything to me but there's a point where you have to think with your head and not your heart which is extremely difficult.

After the conversation I decided to block them from everything and I feel so awful doing that but I wouldn't be able to make any progress with still being able to contact them or vice versa.

Starting my senior year I’d come to peace with a lot of them, and it became once in a blue moon I’d have anything resembling an anxiety attack.

1826,t3_dh4gq4,Not sure how to describe this feeling. It feels like disconnecting from the human?,"Hello. Occasionally I will feel ""disconnected from reality."" It might not grasp the feeling I get. It's just probably just social anxiety. I suppose I will just get this off my chest.

Anyways, sometimes I get this very weird feeling when I become exposed to a  deeper human experience. It freaks me out a lot when I see couples doing public affection right in front of me. It freaks me out when I see a deeper human experience with socializing, sex, love, careers, opportunities, and friendships. I hate this feeling so much and I just want to stop feeling this way.

I would say I am pretty good at social interactions. I can make a ton of acquaintances and have pleasurable interactions with others. I only have two good friends at my college and I am thankful for having them in my life. We support each other. I have an assertive and articulate voice that masks the shakiness from inside. I know how to make people laugh (not the fake laugh we all do lol). 

I am not bitter to any of that or envious for that matter. It just freaks me out when I dive deeper into what people are and my mental state feels like its disconnects from the human for some time. Some things trigger this feeling like being in large crowds, when people talk about their partners and how much they love them (which I am super happy for them), when people make fun of me for not having anything opportunities going for me based on my upbringing growing up.

I suppose it's a fear of missing out? Maybe it is envy? Maybe I am bitter? I have no idea and I am tired of this. I have puked and I felt so anxious and I hate it. It could also be because I never got the attention I wanted and feel nonexistent when I compare myself to others? I shouldn't be comparing myself with others, but its hard when I am as basic as vanilla ice cream. In my favor, I come with sprinkles so it's not too bad. 

I do a pretty good job looking normal, positive and confident in public which I have going for me lol. I get told a lot from a lot of people that I am too innocent or whatever that means. Maybe that indicates something? What can I do to pull myself up from this? It feels disgusting

I have been dealing with schizophrenia anxiety for the past seven months. Currently, it has been a lot better in dealing with, through medication (Straterra) and a therapist. I have seen over five doctors who are mental health professionals, and they mention that I am not schizophrenic.  No one in my family that I know of has it, though apparently my uncle went through some depression, became more religious, left the army, after he went through torture from enemy combatants when he was in the Bangladesh army, but as far as know he isn't schizophrenic and is married with two teenage kids. I have gone through two psychological evaluations since this started and all of the doctors have said schizophrenic 

However, my research has caused my brain to develop a way to make connections in scenarios where schizophrenics would hear voices. I obsessed with it, searching it over 500 times and more, reading various forums and reddits, posting on reddit and watching simulation. Like I work in sales, and sometimes I will be writing an email and then I realize a schizophrenic would hear a voice saying they are worthless when writing that email. Then my mind would produce a imagined voice saying stuff like ""You are worthless"". Essentially, my brain has now become adept in making connections where schizophrenic situations, and as a result has been able to produce imaginary voices. Keep in mind, all of these fake voices are in my head and I never hear them externally. As well, I only get them when I make the connection or think about it constantly. I do have an inner voice, and these fake voices 

With my medication and therapy, I don't get these fake voices much anymore, except in random times of . But I cannot let the thought of them go. And I find myself always thinking of them a lot, and even getting them randomly at times due to my anxiousness. I cannot let this schizophrenia anxiety go because of the whole voices in head thing.

1840,t3_dgr5am,My story of becoming anxiety-free... Hope it helps.,"It’s possible. I lived it. 

THE BAD: 

I was married to a decent man but we were not in love with each other and were not in a happy relationship. I had constant anxiety and panic attacks weekly. One panic attack was so severe half of my face went numb and drooped and at the ER they thought I might be having a stroke ( I wasn’t).  

I wasn’t a happy person. I didn’t have hobbies or things I enjoyed. I didn’t have any friends out side of my relationship or a social life outside of my husband's family.  

I had undiagnosed PMDD which made me severely depressed and suicidal whenever I was close to my period.  

I saw multiple doctors to diagnose a constant pain in my chest that never went away. It would keep me up a night it was so uncomfortable. 

WHAT CHANGED: 

My husband and I divorced and I dated someone else. I fell madly in love with him and thought all my problem’s were solved. I blamed all my anxiety and depression on the bad marriage. A year later, the man I was seeing left me for another woman and I was thrown into a pit of despair.  

After it was officially over I cried for a solid 22 hours. I had to force myself to eat 12 almonds so I wouldn’t pass out but I had no appetite. No interest in watching television or have any distraction other than (and I realized what this was later) SURRENDER. 

I cried and cried...as much as I had in me. I didn’t allow for anything to distract me from it. I just let it come and come. I was devastated. No one came in to help me. No one rescued me. No one tried to fix it. I just felt it. All of it. I allowed myself to feel how alone I was. It was awful. Truly soul chilling. I was so desperate for relief I went to a coda meeting (codependents anonymous) because I had read a few things in the past that lead me to question if maybe I was. Hey, I was desperate after all. Maybe it could help? 

I went and sat there. Listened. Attempted to speak once and just sobbed. Barely coherent. I wasn’t even sure if I was codependent but I appreciated being surrounded by love and support for whatever I was going through. At the end a woman came up to me and said “you know what I heard tonight? Surrender. Only up from here girl.” 

I went home. No more tears… just numbness. I then asked through social media if anyone knew a good therapist because I was struggling. SO MANY people I would have never guessed reached out to me with either a recommendation or general support. And for the first time, I was vulnerable. I told people I was struggling and I needed help. I had no shame, no ego about it. I didn't care what my friends on social media thought. Fuck anyone who thought less of me for reaching out for help. I just asked for help, from anyone. And this lead me to therapy. 

Someone I barely knew gave me a name of a therapist and I booked an appointment. I made a commitment to go once a week for as long as I was able. I made financial decisions based off making it a priority so I could afford it. I went even on days or weeks when I felt ok. It turns out the days I went to therapy when I wasn’t depressed were days that I found the most insight on my life and really delved deep into unhealthy patterns. When I was struggling however, I remember sitting in therapy and saying how I felt like I was just going through the motions in life and wasn’t every really happy. She was THE ONLY one who told me that was ok. She told me to lean into the idea of not knowing who I was and not rush to fill that emptiness with whatever was around or an easy distraction. So I felt it. I didn’t judge it and I didn’t get frustrated with how long I was in this numb place. I would go out and do things, talk to people, put myself out there. Sometimes I felt engaged but usually I didn’t and I didn’t get frustrated by that. I just kept going. 

I had nothing left to lose. I had zero friends so I joined bumble bff and made plans to meet people. Some people I clicked with, others I didn’t. But regardless I was putting myself out there. Every morning I listened to those cheesy morning motivations on youtube. I still love them. They never fail to put my head in a good place to start my day.  

I went on an anti-depressant the CORRECT way which is gradually which worked very well for me. I don’t give all the credit to the medicine though. I give the credit to the WORK I put in. It was an incredibly slow process. I would get so upset with how long I felt like shit but since my day of surrender I made the promise to myself that I would keep going until I felt in control of my life again.  

I didn’t skip weekly therapy. I made an effort not to get into romantic relationships until I was mentally and emotionally strong enough to be on my own first. I made a huge effort to find a support group of friends that I could be vulnerable with. I read a lot of Brene Brown’s books on shame and vulnerability. I forgave myself for going through a hard time and promised to be kinder to myself. I would actually talk to myself in the car. This isn’t a joke. I would out loud have conversations with myself to “check in” on how I was feeling and I would tell myself, “it’s going to be ok. We are going to get through this together.” For some reason separating the two versions of myself (the happy successful future me, and the present depressed me)helped. I tried out new hobbies (woodworking, ukulele, video editing) some hobbies stuck, others didn’t. I just didn’t stop and I was patient with myself. I’d sleep when I was tired and I try things as I felt ready to. I just didn’t give up.  

This is what I realized… for most of my life I was living other people's perceptions of me. I had NO clue who I really was. So this slow painstaking process involved the following:  

I had to get to know myself first (this was the hardest part). I had to enjoy spending time with myself and start liking it. I had to start loving myself (the self talk car conversations helped). I kind of visualized the kid version of myself asking for help and the adult version of me saying, “it’s ok, I’m here.” Lastly, I had to stop listening to what others said I should do for my life and learn that I could trust myself.

THE RESULT: 

Two years later, I am still on antidepressants but my life is so much fuller. I focus on gratitude and say out loud 3 things I am grateful every day. I don’t let what other people think of me bother me because now I know myself. I don’t let other people influence decisions in my life that affect my happiness. I recently moved to a new city for a job opportunity. I know no one here but I feel good and ready to take on a new challenge. I’m not scared of getting depressed again because I know eventually I’ll work myself out of it. I have deep true friendships that support me regardless of time or space. I continually put myself out there and try to say yes to going out and doing things. Mostly, I just stopped living my life for other people and starting living for myself. 

It didn’t just happen. I worked my ass off for two years. I was patient with myself and adopted this mantra: ""Discipline is having faith in action.” 

I took action and I had faith that those steps would pay off eventually even if it didn’t feel like it at the time. I’m here today to say it did eventually pay off and I’m anxiety free…for now. I’m happy.

1841,t3_dh11c8,Symptoms hours after panic attack?,"I (21f) have been diagnosed with GAD and take 20mg fluoxetine daily. Last night I was hanging out with some friends and my first ever panic attack. 

I was smoking a little weed (from a dab pen) and drinking a little (less than 2 drinks). I’ve smoked more and drank more at the same time many times before and been fine. But last night I guess I got too high too fast and started freaking out. My heart was racing, my friend who is a nurse measured my heart rate at 180bpm even though I was just sitting on the couch! I really, really felt like I was having a heart attack and about to die. Eventually I calmed down enough to go to sleep. 

Now, about 15 hours later, I still have a slightly elevated heart rate (90ish bpm) and my hands are still shaking. Is this normal or expected after a panic attack? Looking for advice/comfort because I don’t know what is normal vs what is a true reason to worry. TIA

I’ve been dealing with health anxiety for about half a year. Feels like almost every day I am battling myself.  Worrying about every little symptom I have, I have another condition that could lead to some pretty serious complications if not taken care of correctly. Although I have gotten all the necessary tests for my condition and they have all come back almost perfect, I still worry about the worst happening, I do go for surgery in a little less than a month for my condition just to get some things fixed, as I will have to do every 5 or so years for the rest of my life. I still find myself worrying every day about my health. Even if it’s nothing that could stem from my condition I still worry about it. To the point where it’s all I can think about. For days I’ll worry about one symptom, feel myself start to get better, then for a couple days feel normal again, then relapse into worrying of another symptom. It’s just a vicious cycle, and I don’t know what to do to help. I have never talked to a doctor about my health anxiety, as I’ve been trying to live with it, and see if I can sort it out. That does not seem to be working, so I think that is my next step. I’m just looking for some advice on how to cope, it would be greatly appreciated.

It was AMAZING! I felt energized without any of the negative side effects that coffee has on me. The only thing is it decreases your appetite (which is common for stimulants). But other than that, it helps me focus and decreases sleepiness.

I know using breathing techniques is very helpful, but once I’m in the panic attack mode I feel like really focusing on how I breathe makes it worse. I get bad usually when I’m in a car for some reason. Also for some reason I feel like I have to do this thing with my stomach, it’s almost like a panting motion and this makes it harder to breathe cause I’m taking in shorter breathes.

1852,t3_dh4bfo,Finally getting some help!,"Hi everyone. Hope y’all are having a nice day.

The other day, I finally convinced the doctor to send me to a psychiatrist... I feel like I’ve been suffering with some undiagnosed mental issue greater than anxiety and depression for a long, long time (I’m in my late 20’s). It’s really stressful to hear that exercise and eating well will fix everything. It’s helped yes. But I can’t workout or be physical 24/7 - it’s just not logical. I’ve dabbled with various antidepressants and I felt like they made my symptoms worse (lack of sleep, suicidal ideation). It just feels like I’m this constant emotional roller coaster. I’m really hoping this psychiatrist can figure out something for me. 

The past two weeks for me have been so rough. I had panic attacks daily. I would cry and sob almost all the time. I didn’t want to eat. I didn’t want to do anything. It was really bad. My doctor put me on another antidepressant to help me until my psychiatrist makes an appointment with me... so, she said it takes about a month to get in. So, I’ve been on it for two days. It felt like I was coming off of meth the first night (I’ve been clean for years). Had four hours of sleep and could not fall back asleep. My mind was racing with some sad thoughts, felt sweaty and shaky. But I guess that’s better than panic attacks and sobbing uncontrollably... 

I’m also in yoga teacher training which I was super excited about but now I don’t feel like I’m good enough. I don’t feel like I have the mental strength to get up, practice, learn the terms and write papers. I’m supposed to be in this positive, meditative, mindful, grateful place and I feel the opposite of that. I don’t feel like I embody what I want to be. So, I’m finding myself upset over that too. 

I just want to get through this next month without a panic attack, to eat more and to actually focus on my studies. I’ll give any updates as the treatment progresses.

1857,t3_dh3zqn,Panic Attack while Driving,"I have never had a panic attack I couldn’t pinpoint how or why it happened. That was until two days ago when I was driving down I-285 in Atlanta, Georgia and again yesterday when I was attempting to drive UBER and make some money for the house.

## I-285

On Monday, I had been selected to run two big runs to Fayetteville and Mooreland. The drive itself would take me approximately and hour an a half. Not a bad drive for both deliveries and then I just needed to go home.

Unfortunately, I had a bad feeling when I started my drive, I kept telling myself that it was okay even though I was also telling myself to cancel the gigs. I didn’t. I felt fine, or as fine as I could with a bad feeling sitting in my stomach. I made it to the pickup location and grabbed my packages. It was simple, uneventful. I convinced myself it was all in my head, and technically, it is always all in my head.

I plugged the closest address into my GPS and I headed on my way. Now, if you live in or around Atlanta, Georgia you know that I-285 is a horrible, horrible place to drive when you don’t have anxiety. I was okay as I drove through traffic on GA-400. It wasn’t that bad and there wasn’t a lot of “traffic” on I-285, but there was a lot of semi-trucks and other vehicles on the road.

I first noticed my anxiety when a yellow truck came up along my passenger side and I clenched the steering wheel tighter. It only got worse from there. I finally make it to my first delivery and then a gas station, the first two people I called didn’t answer the phone, but the third one did. Now, if you live here you know about the new Hands Free law. I’m not allowed to hold my phone, so I use headphones while I drive. I put one in one ear and leave the other side open so I can hear around me. Kayla talked to me for a while which was all I could ask for since I had another delivery thirty minutes from where I currently was.

Once Kayla was on the phone I was able to focus on our conversation and I made it to my delivery. On my way back home my mother called me back finally and was freaking out cause I called her four times when I was panicking. She talked to me until I got home. Talking is a solution but not the best one. And I thought I was better after that…until…

## UBER

This one isn’t quite as long, but this one was weird. I was fine while I drove that morning and while I started my evening UBER run. I had some jack\*ss decide that he was going to be a jerk face while I had a customer in my car and maybe he was what started yesterday’s attack. I was fine or felt fine until I dropped her off, it was the traffic and getting out of her drop off location that I started to notice that I wasn’t okay and that I was panicking again.

I called Kayla again, but it didn’t help this time. I don’t know what happened, but I ended up parked in front of Kapow Comics waiting for my younger brother to get to me.

1858,t3_dgyc0l,I victim-blame and gaslight myself when anxious,"Fair warning: I’m posting some of my thoughts toward myself here. They are not very kind thoughts and might be triggering if you have experienced similar ones or have been gaslit or blamed for anxiety. 


I’ve never posted here, so here goes. 

When I start feeling anxious, I try to use CBT to understand why. But even when I figure out why I feel anxious, my anxiety keeps going up. 

First I’ll think, “I don’t have the luxury of being anxious right now.”

Then, “Just pretend it isn’t real.”

When that doesn’t work, my next thoughts are, “God, you just need attention all the time, don’t you? It’s just like you to fake a panic attack so people will comfort you.”

It starts getting worse. “You’re pathetic - it’s just thoughts and feelings. Get over yourself.” 

I blame MYSELF. Better yet, I blame myself simultaneously in two opposite ways:

1. “There’s nothing wrong with you, and you’re the worst kind of person for pretending to have anxiety for attention when there are people really suffering.” 

2. “You’re a pathetic person and you deserve this anxiety so keep suffering!”

How am I both ‘too good’ to have anxiety and ‘too bad’ to deserve help for it? It doesn’t make sense, but these two thoughts work together to make me feel worse and more confused.

I have been diagnosed with PTSD and general anxiety disorder and PMDD. So I know these things are real. But today I fought off a panic attack for three hours with my brain telling me these terrible things about myself.

I wish I could talk to my mom or dad right now, but they’re the ones who gave me these thoughts I’m fighting.

1891,t3_dgzm6t,So nervous about tonight that I feel like throwing up,"So let me give some context for tonight. I have a this group of friends, 2 in particular, who I grew up with and was really close with. Moved away for college and we drifted apart a little but were still good friends. A year ago I moved in with my gf and we drifted even further apart.

I went on a little road trip for a concert with them back in February. Since then, I've only hung out with them 2 other times, the last time being in July. My severe depression led me to isolate myself and ignore their phone calls when they'd try to invite me over. I have texted them apologizing for being distant but others then that, not much contact. Should also mention they've only met my girl one time.

So tonight the gf of one of those friends is throwing a big Halloween party. I was invited thru text and accepted. Theres going to be lots of booze and some snortables as well. I've been stressing about it for weeks.

I've really tried to narrow down why I am nervous. I think it stems from 3 places.

The long period of no contact and my flakiness over the last months has made me really afraid to confront my friends again. They're going to ask where I've been and I dont know what to tell them. Not about to bring down the party with my depression stories.

I am nervous about my gf. She wont know anybody there and she gets a little out of control when very drunk. And who knows what she will be like after snorting something. I'm scared that something might go wrong with her or she will get out of control and offend somebody.

I have general social anxiety so just that fact that's itll be a large party for at least 4 hours makes me not want to go.

I've talked to my gf and shes allievated some of my fears. Shes told me my friends will be happy to see me, and I might get some light ribbing but it's not like they'll make me feel horrible (hopefully). But idk what advice I'm looking for.

1898,t3_dgys68,My Friend Needs Help And So Do I,"So at the beginning of the school year, I got along with this girl. Let's call her Anna. So Anna and I talked a lot about mental health and she opened up to me about her experiences. She's been cutting herself before and she even had a video of it, which she showed me. She said that she stopped doing it and she's in a better place.

So she's struggling with school work and I decided to help her a lot. However, she showed me her arm and she started cutting herself again because she can't handle the stress and pressure - I felt like I wasn't helping her enough. So I started helping her to the point that I would do projects and assignments for her. Honestly, it's been really exhausting and it's been so hard because I live far from school (like, outside the city). But it feels like she's deliberately guilt tripping me when she says stuff like ""Omg I'm so stupid and everything's hard for me"", ""I didn't print my assignment cause I was waiting for your reply"", ""You're the only one who can help me I have trust issues"", etc. She's been pretty dependent on me. 

Right before our exams, my teacher wanted us to feel relaxed a bit so we just talked and she gave us snacks. It got to the topic of depression and she explained in detail her experience with it. When our teacher left, Anna kind of froze up. She just became expressionless and wasn't responding to anyone. They took her to the guidance counselor. I was thinking if I did something wrong or if I didn't do enough. It felt like it was completely my fault. 

Fast forward to the last day of our exams, we finally saw her after a while. She told us that the school gave her some time and that she can decide when she feels ready to take the exams. Apparently, on the day she ended up in the guidance counselor, her aunt took her to a hospital and had a checkup. They almost admitted her to a ward but her aunt refused because it didn't seem clean and sanitary. Although, Anna is now taking medication and they diagnosed her with GAD and PTSD. She asked me to tutor her in other subjects for her exams but my exams were over and all I wanted to do was relax but like the idiot that I am, I agreed. Again, I felt guilty and I didn't want her to get worse. 

Look, I'm actually hoping she transfers to a different school or gets admitted to a cleaner, better ward and so does Anna. I honestly can't balance everything at the same time. I have my own set of complicated problems as well. I couldn't tell this to my other friends because I didn't want to make the incident be about me and I don't want Anna to feel like a burden or possibly get worse. She did say that she might transfer to another school and her mom agreed but it's still undecided. If she does stay, I don't know if I can take it anymore. I really don't want to hold a grudge against her but she's the reason I sacrificed so much of my time and energy that it's been draining me emotionally and physically.",Anxiety

We only ever have 3 workers for each shift so I’m only with her a couple times a week. She is super serious and picks at any little thing I do, and blamed me for doing a couple of things I didn’t actually do, like locking the doors incorrectly (the manager that night locked them) and because I’m quiet she keeps highlighting it and making me feel like I have to speak all the time in moments when we have no customers. She came in today on the last hour of my shift and slammed the counter with her hand in a jokey way to the current duty manager who left shortly after, but scared the hell out of another colleague who is new like me and he’s a bit quiet like me too. She then goes on about how we’ve added too much popcorn (we never added any)

She makes me feel on edge and nervous because I know that anything I do will get picked apart.

I just... I really hate how I made things so complicated by calling off the wedding. 

And recently I accidentally sent a screenshot of me trying to call him on WhatsApp but I changed his name before because every time his name would pop up, and I was with a friend, or more importantly, when my dad saw it, I was bombarded with questions about us which I just didn’t and still don’t have the answers to.

Lemme know if I’m breaking any rules as I’ve not posted in this sub before, I’ll edit my post accordingly, or if there’s some other sub I should post this in.

The simplest summary is - I don’t have any internal drive left. I don’t know how to phrase it exactly, but a few months back, during my summer vacations between semesters, I just lost all my drive at some point. I’ve had depression for several years now. But this time, I just…lost all interest in everything. I also think that I’m slowly losing my mind. Although I know that it could just be me blowing things out of proportion, I’ve seen and heard about perfectly normal and intelligent people going crazy. Hence, this post.

Here are some instances which might help you understand my problem a bit better:

1. This past summer, I was doing an awesome machine learning internship, my project was great, had helpful and intelligent mentors to guide me, great community and all - it was just a great opportunity. If I had to guess, I’d say it happened somewhere from the end of May to the mid-June period. I gradually became disinterested in doing the work, writing the code, etc even though the project itself remained interesting. In the end, I didn’t bother opening up my laptop to do any work, just stopped doing anything despite knowing I shouldn’t. It was similar to the feeling of procrastination, only 10X stronger.
2. I used to read a lot of academic papers in the previous semester, was in the zone for my exams, smashed them - scoring close to highest in almost every subject. After and during this summer, I’ve read a total of 0 papers, I’m doing relatively poorly in my academics, I don’t even try reading papers or studying like I won’t even open the textbook or download a paper, I just started feeling indifferent to that stuff.
3. I had a great social life going the past semester. During this entire summer, I barely talked to 5 people and in less than a hundred texts over three months. I didn’t bother texting people and they apparently didn’t care to text me first either, which means that they weren’t interested in being friends anyway. This semester, the only people I’ve talked to are a couple of people living next to me, and my crush. The reason I’m talking to them is that they live right next to me, and I do enjoy some of their companies. But it sort of sucks my energy and after hanging out once, I’m drained out. I don’t take naps because I’m usually on caffeine or modafinil which don’t let me sleep.
4. Talking about the crush, I remember times when I used to actively pursue a romantic interest. Now, even though I have strong feelings towards my crush, I don’t even go to the classes I have in common with her even though if I go, we tend to sit together. She’s told me that she goes to the gym at so and so time but I don’t even bother showing up at times even though I’d really really like to bond with her. I’m not getting any internal motivation or push to do anything even though I’m sure that it will help me get together with her.
5. With my resume, I’d get into a lot of great universities and companies for the summer. I’ve applied to a total of 0 companies this semester. I don’t know why - I know it’s good for me and that I should be doing it but somehow I just spend the entire day lying down in my bed and staring at the ceiling - evening comes around - play badminton for some time - come back to reddit - sleep - repeat.
6. I used to read a lot of books. I finished reading 60 books this year by July. Your typical huge book nerd. Since July, I’ve read a total of 5 books, 4 of them in July and August and 1 in September.
7. For the past few days, this is one of the scariest things to ever happen to me. I’ve been seeing something move in the corner of my eye - I look over there and there’s never anything. I’ll be sitting in my room doing something on my laptop when I’ll notice something or someone moving in the corner of my room from the corner of my eye. I’ll look over - there’s never anything.
8. I’ve got relatively very few friends. The number of people I count as my extremely close friends is even lesser. Two of them, let’s call them S and M, both guys, are close as well. They’ve been having fun, throwing jokes at one another, and it’s been making me jealous, even though I’ve never felt this way before. I know it’s totally unjustified - they should have fun - but I’ve been feeling really insecure over how I might get left out.
9. I know I should be proofreading this post and clear out the redundant sentences, etc, but I don’t feel like I have any energy to even scroll up and read through all of this. I just want to lie down and have some TV running in the background. It’s like my life in running and It’s all just a background noise with me being numb to everything.
10. Also, I love my parents, my brother, and would love to video call them, spend hours talking to them on the phone, etc but these days they text me all day, and I’m usually sending back 1 word replies, just answering the question without making convo because apparently to my brain, even texting my parents and brother takes too much energy. Sometimes days go by and I’ve not talked to them and they get worried and I love them and want to talk to them but doing a phone call feels exhausting.

TLDR; I’ve lost all internal drive and motivation to do ANYTHING and it’s driving me crazy but I’m still not doing anything other than just lying down in my bed almost the entire day and probably have some TV series running in the back.

Feel free to ask any questions. I’ll answer as many as I can.

**EDIT: Another important thing I should've mentioned is that I'm a high-functioning guy. I can finish essays that take others 3-4 hours in less than 30 minutes. I studied for my midterm exams about 6-7 hours this semester (just the last day study really) and still am scoring 8+ (out of 10) GPA. This is not me bragging at all, hell, it won't do me any good even if I did for some fake internet points. It actually elevates the problem because from the outside I'm getting great marks, so probably studying, etc. I'm not eating much and periodically causing me to lose weight but people think that it's because I'm working out. Even leaving my room to go to the common mess room and then sitting with so many people to eat something as irrelevant as food is too much effort again, I just don't bother going most of the time.**",Anxiety

Today, I took a road trip with one of my best friends to visit our other best friend five hours away from home. I’m sitting on her deck looking out at the ocean and I feel so free.

I used to walk into public places, and imagine all these imaginary scenarios that would happen, people I'd bump into, doing something to embarrass myself.

So, this would lead me to walk in and panic, because all of these *stressful* , negative thoughts would *stress me the fuck out*

I'd speak to the employee (if spoken to) and I'd speak nervously. I'd instantly begin to fixate on how my voice sounds, and in turn, make a *minor* embarrassment of myself.
And that would then give me anxiety that people saw it. Then that would add to my already anxious state of mind. 

Repeat.



Now?


I just don't even *think* about anything when I walk in.
I just think about what groceries am going to buy and get on with it.

I know it doesn't sound like much, and I know it can be *fucking HARD* to just ""switch off your mind and focus on the present"", and to be honest I don't even know when and how the fuck I started doing it...but it's changed everything

I feel so much more confident with myself when am not focused on constantly berating myself for absolutely *nothing*

I can just walk in and be *present*

A year ago, I couldn't go anywhere without being in a constant state of anxiety and panic. 

I remember this one moment...This just *one* moment, where I was walking through the city, and I just felt...at *peace*. I didn't feel nervous, I didn't feel negative, I was just...*calm*.

And yeah, I'd be lying if I said I've *completely* gotten rid of my anxiety; but it's gotten a *whole lot* better.

1932,t3_dgvqs1,I hate medical anxiety,"My anxiety has been through the roof for the past couple of months and it's only getting worse. 

Basically, I'm a 22F college student and lost 2 immediate family members in the same week back in July. One of them was my brother who was only a year older than me, a very sudden and unexpected loss (we still don't know the cause). Because we're not sure if it's a genetic cause or not, I figured I would get a checkup just to make sure all is well with me. Everything thus far (I've gotten 2 physical exams, had an EKG done, and pretty comprehensive blood work) has been normal, except yesterday the doctor called and informed me my liver levels are super elevated, she said they are normally in the 30s but mine are in the 400s. I was already scheduled to get an echocardiogram next week just as a precaution, but now they are adding an ultrasound of my liver to the agenda. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dgmbxv/im_22_and_my_doctor_found_elevated_liver_function/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) if you're interested. I've never drank, smoked, done drugs, etc. So I'm here like.... what gives.

So, naturally, I've been super paranoid and antsy about my health since my brother's passing. I've already been dealing with generalized anxiety for a while now and have been in therapy for over a year for it. Now that I'm in limbo - waiting to hear what caused my brother's passing, waiting to hear if there's something wrong with me - it's even worse. Ever since the call yesterday I'm finding it hard to think about much else and honestly am tempted to just go to the hospital to speed up the testing process, but I'm not having any obvious symptoms (other than elevated stress issues which, anxiety) and the doctor on the phone yesterday only told me to go if I have abdominal pain. 

I suppose this is more just venting than anything but my anxiety thrives on uncertainty and my usual calming mechanisms aren't really working this time :( I also have been googling everything under the sun and it's not helping, most of the causes of elevated liver function sound like a death sentence. I'm terrified of ending up like my brother and wow anxiety sucks.",Anxiety
1933,t3_dgle8e,I keep assuming everyone thinks the worst of me.,"So, honestly I don't know if I even deserve to be on this sub, since I've never been officially diagnosed, but honestly I think I suffer from some sort of anxiety, possibly more than one.

More and more, I've stopped seeing life as something to look forward to and more as a few brief reprieves before a series of regrets and failures. It's like, every time I talk to someone, or even just stay in the same room with someone, I find a way to embarrass myself.

To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, let me write about this exchange student program I took part in.

I was to stay with a host family for a week while I went abroad with my school. While I was there, I found that I really disliked their cooking, so I would try to avoid eating it if possible, and hid the lunch they made for me in my bag. 

On my last day, the parent found out about my dislike for her food when she discovered the uneaten lunch. Things smoothed over before I left, but to this day, I still constantly think about how poorly they must think of me, and how much of a brat I must've seemed, despite my attempts to be polite, and how much they must've despised me. I think about it so much that I sometimes have trouble sleeping because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, I know they probably don't hate me; it was a minor thing, it was 5 years ago, I was 12, they probably don't even remember me, if they think about the events at all, they might not even remember my name.

It doesn't really help.

This is just an example of a variety of events I regret. If I had all night, I could list, in accurate detail, practically everything I regretted doing just this scholastic year, and I fear this list is only going to get longer as time grows on.

I just can't stop thinking about it. I keep thinking that everyone must think I'm dumb, ugly, stupid, annoying, self absorbed, arrogant, ad infinitum. I mean, realistically everyone probably doesn't think of me at all, but I can't shake the idea of constant peer judgement and subsequent rejection.

Going out with people is stressful on me, as though at any moment they'll realize how fucked up I am, or they'll decide I'm too awkward to deal with and won't even pretend to like me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to live the rest of my life regretting all my social interactions. Is there anything I can do to overcome this hurdle?",Anxiety
1934,t3_dgvloa,Need Some Help Post Episode!,"Hi Guys -

  


  


So - long term anxiety sufferer here, made my way through by going on SSRIs at times - and others (like now) take meds on an ""as needed"" basis. More recently my anxiety has presented itself as fear of public speaking. This is a problem because public speaking is a BIG part of my job.

  


  


Anyway - in a very stressful time in our business and had a BIG presentation yesterday in front of the brass. I practiced, and was on low dose of ativan during the week to keep the anxiety at bay. I went into the presentation with only taking 0.5 mg of ativan the night before and morning of took 20 mg of propanolol. There were 4 people presenting and I made sharp/solid comments during their turns. As the time for my run came though it was like nothing could keep the fear at bay - even though I had taken the propanolol it was like I was beginning to have an out of body experience, like I was just going to literally break down/passout/otherwise.. I keep a 0.5mg ativan in my coat pocket and I took about 1/2 40 minutes before my turn and another 1/2 about 5-10 minutes before my turn.

  


I ran through my section - and in my mind I was like ""everyone can tell I'm on ativan - they're averting their eyes because its so bad"" - it was a little difficult to find my wording in situations and I felt about 25% less sharp or slower than my normal self (Still better than ending up in a puddle of tears without any of the meds).

  


Feedback afterwards was ""you did great"" and when I solicited feedback I got a range from ""You were the best, crisp concise and clear"" to ""you came off a bit too polished"" to ""you seemed a little arrogant"" to ""Your sort of lost a little energy at the end (This person said I did great the day of unsolicited). I think of all the reasons people might have thought I was on something but just to be nice say some positive things - and then I focus on the negative. I was on a call with two peers 15 minutes after the presentation and I felt none of the difficulty finding words or like I may have been slurring my speech.

  


I CANNOT stop thinking that somehow though I took too much ativan and people could clearly tell I was slow/on something I can not stop obsessing that I somehow ruined my career. I keep trying to think how I can get more feedback that make me feel better but it's almost like I'm trying to confirm my suspicion.

I used to have eating disorders, but no more.

of course, there is so much more that i wont even go into. most of these mentions have either changed in nature or perhaps lessened, but never left me. i know i cant expect to be completely cured and fixed, but i dont know if this is worth it. i mean, ive been hospitalized and treated so many times i feel as though there isn’t anything more that can be done for me. should i still get screened or something to know what i have right now? most doctors have turned a blind eye to my mental health bc i was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness (you see my luck?)

1959,t3_dgr9a1,How to stop feeling so anxious when drinking alcohol?,"I’ve been drunk a few times. The first time I went slow and drank lots of water, so it was enjoyable. The second time I went faster and drank more, but I still didn’t feel gone or anything. There was about a ten minute span where I felt pretty anxious but it wore away. 

The third time was tonight. I was running on about four hours of sleep, I barely drank any water, I went fast, and I had very little to eat. I only drank about 3-4 drinks in about an hour, but I was as drunk (if not more drunk) as the time I had 7 drinks. About an hour after drinking, I got a lot of anxiety. I couldn’t really loosen up. At some points, the alcohol really took effect and caused me to be outgoing, but most of the time I just felt uncomfortable. As the alcohol wore off, I still felt really tired and anxious for the rest of the night. I even had to leave my friends early because I couldn’t deal with it anymore. 

It just sucks because drinking is supposed to be a way to loosen up and have fun, but it’s like my brain tries to fight it. As if when I lose control, my brain starts to worry and I get anxious. I also have a lot of fun when drinking, but the anxiety ruins it.

He’s the first guy i’ve been with since my last relationship that ended a year ago. My last boyfriend was mentally and sexually abusive, in general it was just a really toxic and traumatic relationship. So now I always have a guard up especially around men.

Despite that I really like this guy, but we’ve only hung out a couple of times. When i’m with him in person I find it hard to talk and just be myself with him because i’m so scared to be vulnerable with someone again out of fear they will take advantage of me. It’s even worse when we kiss or cuddle, the whole time my heart it racing and he says he can feel me physically shaking so he’s stopped trying to be intimate with me because he says it feels like he’s doing something wrong.

We recently got into an argument because I noticed he hasn’t been putting in the effort into seeing me and he admitted it was because whenever we are together It’s so awkward because I just shut down and if he doesn’t say anything we will just sit there in silence.

I feel terrible because I just want to be able to talk to him, why must something that seemingly is such an easy thing to do be so damn hard for me? He’s been really patient and understanding with my anxiety but I know he is starting to take me being unable to socialize with him personally.

He recently moved away about 2-3 months ago for a job and I think I’m dealing with separation anxiety of some sort. Lately I’ve been feeling really strange and certain lighting makes me feel like I’m dissociating (it’s mostly the fluorescent lights at my school). I have a habit of scaring myself and thinking of highly irrational things like I’m going to go blind or have a stroke, just wild things. I visited my mom this week and my sleep schedule was all wack. I kept waking up at like 3:30 am and couldn’t fall back asleep until 5. I’m having a hard time eating and when I do I immediately feel sick afterwards. I haven’t thrown up but I have had some diarrhea(sorry for the TMI). Also sometimes I just get panicked out of nowhere and I start feeling dizzy and lightheaded like I’m about to pass out but I haven’t. I feel groggy which is probably the result of my messed up sleep schedule. 
I’ve talked to my dad about it, who has anxiety. He’s prescribed Xanax for his but says he rarely has to take it. He thinks I should talk to a psychiatrist and I do too. What I’m worried about is that I won’t feel normal again, but I also get the feeling that if my boyfriend were here I would feel all better. He’s coming to visit me for Thanksgiving and I’m really excited:). I don’t want to have to depend on him to make me feel better though. This week he’s been busy and I find myself calling him over and over or waiting by my phone for a text from him so that he can calm me down, which he’s really good at.

1971,t3_dgpnk0,"Made an appointment for an initial evaluation with a psychiatrist, and now I'm worrying about my decision and wondering if I should've chosen a psychologist instead","So for a long time, I've struggled with getting paralyzed by fear about certain decisions or tasks, in particular school assignments. But in the past, I was always able to work around this, because I got very good at doing things at the last minute. However, this fear REAAALLY got to me when I was studying for the bar exam, to the point where I was practically unable to study at times. Without going into it too much, I think I might have failed the bar exam due to possible anxiety. But I'm not sure if that's what it is.

I'm about to get my bar results, and I am 99.99% sure I didn't pass. I'm trying to get ready to make some changes before taking it again, so I don't just make the same mistakes and fail the second time. One step is seeing someone for migraines, the other is seeing someone for potential anxiety.

I have NEVER done anything like this before, I've never gotten therapy or anything like that. So I was sort of overwhelmed by figuring out what exactly to do. My dad said a psychiatrist is like a psychologist, except a psychiatrist can also prescribe medication. So if they decided medication would help, they could just prescribe it, and skip the step of referring me. I'm not opposed to medication - I am open to it, if it turns out I really need it to get through some of the times I'm most panicked by things. So I made an appointment with a psychiatrist. But now I'm worried that a psychiatrist might focus more on prescribing me medication, and less on other types of help for the problem, like therapy.  As I said, I'm open to medication, but I'd like to try other means of getting help for the problem as well, probably before I just jump to taking medication. Should I cancel this appointment and make one with a psychologist? Or is this a good starting point? I don't really know what I'm doing at all, and I'm stressing out about it.

1974,t3_dgm9gm,"Is it true that people who suffer from health anxiety ""make up"" the symptoms","At least that was how the doctor explained it to me when i went because i was convinced i was dying, he said essentially that my brain will create symptoms to validate my fears in a way. I went there for my neck because i was convinced i was having a clogged artery and all my symptoms included burning face through shoulder, numb feeling in face, pain in neck, spots in eye and more all on my left side and after i finally was brought to a psychiatric hospital they explained that its called somatisicing(?) and pretty much all it means is my brain is creating false symptoms due to the absolute belief that something is wrong. And even though i didnt really believe him cause what i felt was REAL, i chose to trust him and attempt to ignore it, after a day it almost immediatley went away except for a little sharp pain cause i had a slight strain from pressing on it too hard while constantly checking my pulse.

During the time i thought i was having a heart attack i felt pain in my arm and chest that was like pressure that even moved into my jaw, again, outside of the sharp pain in my chest caused from improper carrying of something heavy once my tests came back negative for heart problems it went away very quickly, and i could keep going but the idea remains, I have one simple problem which i then essentially create more symptoms to validate my catastrophic beliefs  that its something serious until a medical professional tells me otherwise and even then i dont completley believe them as the things i feel are real.

So thats my question to anyone reading this with anxiety, is it normal to ""make up"" symptoms that arnt real? Currently im having a constant sense of impending doom which stems from me worrying about accidentally taking too much of prozac and that is getting my all riled up because either my heart is beating too ""low"" (about 60 bpm) or too ""high"" (above 86) and that is making me think that my heart is hurting and then my arm hurts and shoulder hurts all over again until i am in a constant state of extreme anxiety for the rest of the day.",Anxiety

Anyone ever experience a strange sensation that engulfs your entire body, starting out at your extremities and finally converging at your head where it peaks before slowly dissipating? I can only describe it as a ""whoosh"" that's unlike anything I've ever felt before. It happens from time to time and was very terrifying the first few times it happened, but I've learned to cope with it a bit more now.

I haven't been officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder, but I don't have enough fingers to count the number of times I've been to the ER over the past year and a half due to symptoms mimicking a heart attack or stroke. Every time, they do blood work, EKGs, and xrays , but end up saying everything comes back negative and that it was probably just anxiety. Assuming I do have some kind of anxiety disorder, I have a hypothesis that this sensation is just a quick and sudden release of tension that has gradually built up within the nerves and muscles over a period of time. I notice that this sensation is always preceded by episodes of chest pains, heart palpitations, labored breathing, and other symptoms.

My hope is that other people are able to identify with this because that could indeed mean that this sensation is anxiety-related. It would certainly help me come to grips with it when it occurs rather than send me into a feeling of dread and impending doom.",Anxiety

I just had 3 done yesterday and although it's been about 12 years since I've been wanting to get them, I had a full blown anxiety attack last night over the most visible one to me and the most meaningful because it's related to my anxiety (it's not even big wtf).

1993,t3_dgmx9y,How to get over losing friends?,"Obvious throw away. But here goes.

This happened around 7 years ago (I know, I’m lame.) but I had a friend id been friends with for 3-4 years during high school. She was a few years older than me. She was looking for an apartment in the town I lived in and I told her how much I liked my apartments. They were manicured and had mainly old people so it was nice and quiet.

Long story short, she moved in. After around 7 months or so, the maintenance guy (who lived in the apartment UNDER mine) broke into my friends apartment. He wrote dirty things in her PERSONAL journal of all the stuff he wanted to do to her. She was terrified and freaked out. I was too.

She moved out that week, blocked my number, and never talked to me again. It hurt because none of this was my fault and I was scared too. I still have a dvd of hers she let me borrow :/

Another story: I met a girl who had a cool Goku tattoo on her ankle. She was around my age and clearly liked anime too. We texted for awhile and then we hung out at my apartment. (Way before the incident above happened). She went out to smoke a cigarette, but then never came back -_-

How do I get over the anxiety of never being good enough to make new friends and get over the ones that left? I’m introverted so it hurts worse that I suck at making friends. I’ve stopped trying at all because it hurts worse to think I could have a friendship but they always all leave. 

Any advice is welcome, please be kind.",Anxiety
1994,t3_dgjwys,My child had a major meltdown today.,"A year and a half ago my daughter (almost 9 now) was diagnosed with anxiety and depressive moods and began counseling. My mother also has severe GAD, as well as one of my sisters and they use medication without therapy.

I'm at work and my mother is babysitting. She texted me a little bit ago telling me that ""something is going on"" because my kid is throwing a major tantrum. Screaming, defiance, threatening to punch her cousins, refusing to go have a time out, etc. My mom, being anxious herself, was panicking trying to deal with it.

I know when she pulls the ""something is going on"" card she is insinuating that there is some sort of conspiracy going on in my house causing my daughter to act out. My mom is always making assumptions that I'm to blame for my daughter's anxious and depressive flair ups, and yet with her own anxiety can come to terms that sometimes there isn't a reason. It doesn't seem fair and it really makes me feel upset, hopeless, and like I have no control. My mom doesn't trust me despite having no reason to feel that way and it's always a problem. I try to be patient and understand this is likely a symptom of her anxiety, but it's really hard.

My boyfriend and co-parent of 5 years has moved out because my mom would not stop harassing me because she doesn't trust him.. it's a whole different issue.. Point is its just the two of us at home. She throws fits at home, of course, she is a child. But she doesn't throw these extreme fits at home; she has an anxiety station/alter equipped with a relaxation box of fidgets and puzzles, a worry plaque, pen and papers, tarot, etc. At home she self soothes. 

I've created power points about the neurology of anxiety, how it's normal and common. Ive shown her documentaries on mental health. I'm always practicing patience as well as trying to provide appropriate discipline, which is still necessary even when a child has anxiety. For example, not rewarding inappropriate behavior and not allowing the child to victimize themselves and blame everyone around them rather than being accountable (something my mom is always doing, and I feel it's a bad influence!)

My daughter is young and has so much to learn still! Just yesterday she told me her counselor didnt fix her, and I had to explain that it is not the counselor's duty to *fix* her, that a counselor is a guide to learn to maintain or ""fix"" yourself. 

I worry that because of my mother's severe GAD, PTSD, and serotonin syndrome, that she may not have the patience and endurance to ""deal with"" my kiddo in the way that I think is best. She would rather blame me, and have a solid answer for the behavior (that something bad is going on at home that I'm keeping secret.)

I'm frustrated with my mom because her way of dealing with her anxiety is to pop klonopin and that's it. No self analysis, no therapy, no breathing exercises, meditation, spirituality, or anything. While I have nothing against medication, I dont think it's enough to rely on meds alone. I dont like the example it sets, and my mom is a person I have a lot of relationship issues with as is because she is paranoid, manipulative, and controlling. 

I'm struggling and I don't know what to do anymore!

1998,t3_dgmnig,I don't know what to do with this information (tw talk about death),"I guess this post kind of functions as my way of processing. 

My grandfather, who I love dearly and have always had a fantastic relationship with, is dying. Not an all at once kind of thing, no horrific accident or anything. He's had congestive heart failure for a very long time. A few days ago a doctor made a point of asking if he would like to be resuscitated, and said that some people can go for another 10 or 20 years, in a way that greatly implied that he won't. There was a mention of next spring. I wasn't there, but the general sense is a year or two. 

What do I do with this information? The only person in my family who has died was my great grandfather, and I barely remember him. This is uncharted territory, but more than that is the constant pit of anxiety I have right now, and have had for the last couple days. I feel sick, I feel like crying, I feel like getting angry at *something*. But I can't.  I don't know what to do. He's never been very good at coping skills - he knows, but he's tuning it out. 

How am I even supposed to function with this information? What if it's less than a year? How will we know? What if something happens and he could be saved, but we don't catch it in time? I can't get rid of the pit or anxiety. It's churning my stomach and making me constantly feel sick.

2001,t3_dgilrc,"I beat my anxiety today, but it almost beat me. Today was a test to see just how bad my anxiety disorder is, and let me tell you, she’s as big and toxic as EVER! The most evil trickster, more terrifying than any childhood nightmares, in my opinion!","So, my oral hygiene depleted past 7 years since having depression, anxiety and BDD so in turn i got too anxious to ever goto the dentist and finally book an appointment last Monday and just got out of it 20 minutes ago.

To say the least, my anxiety and fears of being embarrassed about my teeth, to the point I was diagnosing my oral condition and convinced myself I was going to lose all of my bottom teeth, thought I’d have decay from the relatable posts/articles I could find, and that my insurance wasn’t going to cover enough.

Turns out that’s why I hadn’t gone on top of being too stuck in the hole of never practicing enough self care and personal hygiene. Well, the dentist didn’t tell me any of those things were wrong. In fact my teeth are in great condition, i do have some gum inflammation but nothing a couple of visits can’t fix. 

My point in this post is, I spent 7 years without going to a dentist all because of that little bastard of a voice (anxiety) manipulating my brain and creating scenarios that haven’t even happened to sabotage my health and keep me a prisoner to these thoughts and my poor oral health. 

It’s evil. All week I had the hardest time sleeping, eating, and sitting still because I was terrified that everything I had been thinking and researched would be true. I had 4 panic attacks between yesterday and today in the parking lot of the dentist office and even threw up. 

All for what? The dentist to tell me my teeth were good and we would set up treatment for my TREATABLE gums? Wasn’t that bad? Never thought any of those words would come out of their mouth. But that’s where anxiety can be so detrimental, it paralyzes you, and it certainly did for 7 years. But today, I had the strength and can see a tiny light at the end of the tunnel. 

I’m taking this day and running with it! I feel like I really won today, I almost canceled the appointment, glad I was strong enough to follow through. A step closer to being able to manage/cope through this crippling disorder!",Anxiety

2004,t3_dgm6g2,What should I do?,"Sorry for the long post... 

For context I live in a rough neighborhood in South Africa with my mom and my twin sister. We're all Zimbabweans, but moved SA in 2009. There used to be four of us until my parents split in 2013. My dad still lived nearby in town so me and my sis would go visit him every week. One day though I went to visit him alone and arrived to see about 3 different bags stashed with all his clothing. I asked him if he was going somewhere and he said he just likes keeping them there, and I didn't put a single thought into it. Well, the next week I arrived to see his landlord had broken in because my dad had disappeared, with the keys and that month's rent money. It was around late 2016 at that point.

(Mid 2017) I later find him on Facebook and ask him where's he's been and he says he told me he's going to Australia I was kinda shocked, but I didn't put much thought into it either( yeah, fuck me). I find out he has a family there and I have a newborn stepsister... cool. We talk a lot the rest of the year abt how we'll go live with him there after we graduate from high school. My parents thought it'd be good since the economy is way much better there and there are more opportunities there. He said he'd send money for us to get our own visas and new passports and follow him. Me and my sis would be studying there while living with him. During early last year, my grandparents came from Zimbabwe to live with us for abt a month, highlight of the visit was my grandmother having a talk with me and my sis one night abt our family history. She tells us everything abt how when we were born my Dad cheated on my mom and the reason they split up is because he was cheating again, among other things.

At this point I don't even like the guy anymore. Still we that doesn't affect our plan to go, and I decide I'll talk to him abt it one day. He was also supposed to be sending money to us every month, but he'd only send like every 3 months or so. But We'd see him on his WhatsApp status flexing his two new cars, house and great life over there. Even when I'd text him I'd have to be the one to initiate a conversation, otherwise we'd go like a month without talking. 

For precaution me and my sis had already applied for Universities in SA. After we graduated in 2018, he pushed the the time for us to begin the process from January to April saying he didn't have enough money yet. Then again from April to July, saying the same thing. At this point we we're supposed to already have gone to Zimbabwe and started working on the travel documents. Instead of sending the money he'd said that he's decided to come in person and help us with all that... cool. A week later he boards his plane, which was supposed to head for Singapore then come here to SA. Upon reaching Singapore, my mother tells us that my dad said he doesn't have the money. With a lot of questions running through all our minds we don't say anything, me and my sister both try to text him trying to ask what's going on, but he just blue ticks us. Everyone deletes his number and we decide to move on, focusing on studying here next year.",Anxiety

2007,t3_dgkaof,Has Anyone Tried to Make a Conscious Effort to Be Healthy?,"Recently I had just finished watching the movie Super Size Me. It is not my first time watching it as I have watched it before a very long time ago in grade school. Now the premise in the movie was to eat nothing but McDonald's for 30 days to see what the effects were on the body. To no surprise, Morgan (the test subject) was worse off mentally and physically after the 30 days had passed. This got me thinking, has anyone here tried to be healthy for 30 days or just in general as a remedy for anxiety and depression?

Now what I mean is, eating a well balanced diet (minimized sugars, more vegetables, none or reduced fast foods), sleeping well (6-8 hours every night) and exercising regularly?

And in no way am I suggesting that people should try this instead of medication or therapy. Nor am I suggesting that this a solution for clinical depression and anxiety. It just got me thinking about how our current lifestyles, mine specifically, might be hindering us. If you think about it, if you eat poorly, or sleep terribly or don't exercise at all, how great would you actually feel? For some, this thought might even make you feel slightly anxious. I'd imagine that I'd feel pretty crappy, anxious as hell and pretty depressed if my sleep was terrible alone.

A lot of people spend time and resources on everything else but general health, myself included. So I was thinking of making a conscious effort focusing on diet, sleep and exercise just to see how I might feel after a sustained period of time.

Personally, I've been diagnosed with GAD and I'm curious as to how my anxiety would respond to a major but overall better lifestyle change. Lastly, I understand something like this is hard. We don't always have time or money to make the best decision in the moment. This was more of a shower thought type idea.

Edit: Also, I'd like to add that if you have tried and have had positive or negative results, I'd genuinely like to read about them. Any commentary is welcomed.",Anxiety
2008,t3_dgghpx,5 week celexa update,"Hey y’all. I know a lot of people here are hesitant to take meds, and so was I, so I thought I would share my experience. 

I started cekexa 5 weeks ago. I will say the first 3 weeks weren’t great. Worsened depression, anxiety, tired all day, low libido and couldn’t orgasm. I was close to stopping but everyone said give it 4 weeks so I trudged on. Mid last week, I woke up one day and felt, calm? I have co depression and for the first time in 6 months I didn’t look at a belt and wonder what I could do with it. The thoughts in my head calmed down. My dad was traveling for work and while I usually assumed the worst (it never happened) I just thought oh have fun.

 I went out to a bar (watch your booze intake if you’re legal) and I had a free flowing conversation. I didn’t have to think about my next word, and even made eye contact. Here’s how I describe what was happening. I went to a concert, a situation that would normally send me off an edge. Loud music, crowds, being away from home. Normally I work myself up, and I go into full panic mode, I have to leave, I have to pop a Xanax. This time, I got close to the cliff, but I never got those panic symptoms. Sure I felt anxious, but everyone does. The important thing is that it didn’t ruin my night. 

So to anyone considering meds. Give it a shot. I feel happier. I got a girls number. I have a positive outlook on life. (By the way the sexual side effects went away. Still a little more work to orgasm but I don’t mind ha). I don’t even care if these brain chemicals are store bought on pill form. You know what’s worse than taking a pill?

2009,t3_dglwsf,"Today I had an argument with my supervisor, instead of letting her talk me down I stood up for myself. FOR THE FIRST TIME!","DISCLAIMER! This is quite long and involves some bad language and if you're uncomfortable in arguments, this thread could make you uncomfortable. Also I'm not a native English-speaking person and on mobile. 

Short about me: I'm doing an apprenticeship, currently in housekeeping. I'm 18f and have had severe problems with depression and anxiety. I particularly choose this apprenticeship, because it helps with being more open and outgoing. That because you have no other choice when working as a waitress. 

There's never much to actually do after 3 pm ( I always work from 10 to 18:30 ) I try my best to keep myself busy, but I'm still learning and running out of ideas. Today my supervisor catched me in the basement, waiting for my time to go ( it was only 5 minutes, she came in 3 minutes after me ) I sat down on a chair and listened to some music, as she came down I jumped up. 

She started by saying "" OOH emllik2 this can't be true, that's not the first time I catched you. Your work spirit is really under the ground "" she said much more than that like "" I thought you were old enough to come up with own ideas, how are you gonna supervise the bistro -
 ( it's a little restaurant at the beach which they want me to supervise, even though my work spirit is really bad /s ) 
- I'm gonna talk to the director and wright it down on your rating"" 

First things first, my work spirit bitch ? Yesterday I did extra hours to help out in the bistro. Last month I had school and should've had 3 weekends free, but I came in and helped. One day even from 5pm to 3 am and next day 10 am to 4pm. I said to her "" it's unfair for you to say so, I always try to keep myself busy. I've not been working in housekeeping for years, how do you expect me to find all work by myself "" 

She arguments with me being old enough... yeah right, that's what it's about.

Second, you catched me sitting down before ? Well give me shit to do, your girls that have been here for years, chill out and sit down somewhere if there's nothing to do. I said that but with more respect.

How am I gonna supervise the bistro? Well if you gave a shit about the law, I wouldn't even be allowed to. I said "" I don't know how I'll run it, maybe some of you professionals will help me. Which is part of your job, I'm being paid to learn, work and follow instructions "" 

She wasn't too happy about that comment and said something like "" I have many more things to do than help you run a bistro or give instructions "" well bitch wtf are you doing AAAAA

I'm still so angry about this, I nearly cried during the argument but kept it together. My lip starting shaking but I quickly pushed my lips together as she noticed. I cried about an hour as I got home. 

Also I asked her if she's gonna Wright my report like I just sat down the whole Damn time. She said she's going to look at my work the next and happily last 3 weeks and then decide. I just let out a nose blow and said OK 
"" well it's already 18:34, I better get going, not that I stay too long "" 
I mentioned this because she always stresses me to finish my work in time ( which I always do ) and if I stay a minute longer she'll be super pissed.

Today was the first day I thought about actually killing myself for maybe 2 or 3 months now, even though I'm proud on how I handled the argument. I cried a lot, took a depression bath and ate a big pizza with my boo. It's scary how something so relatively small, throws me off the lane so bad. 

It just really hurt when she said I didn't have any work spirit, I put so much in this, i want to do it perfect and always give my best. 

I forgot to add that I had one headphone in while doing my work, it was very quit and hidden well. 
She said I should take it out ( no problem ) that I don't wear it when I'm in the restaurant
 "" yeah because I'm around guests there the whole time, I'm not when I'm polishing the floor or cleaning bathrooms "" 
Still "" YOU don't wear it in the restaurant and also not in housekeeping it's a no go "" 
Which is absolutely no problem but she could've been a little reasonable about it. 

Stupid bitch.
