4,t3_dkqxtn,I planned to jump from my school’s rooftop,"I posted this to r/confession but it was removed. I’m still not really sure why, so I decided to try posting this here.

To start, I’m a 16 year old girl. I have told this story to no one. Not even my therapists. I feel to ashamed. But no people who I know in real life know I have Reddit, so maybe this will ease my guilt.

I was only 13. I don’t remember the exact date. All I remember is that it was a Wednesday in the hot summer. I had wanted to end my life for a while. I was just too much if a coward to do it. But after another night of my dad coming home drunk and yelling at me and my mom crying again, I couldn’t do it.

I looked at the map of my school to find out how to get to the roof. My school was five stories tall. I figured that would do the trick. I wrote down the pros and cons of whatever method I would use.  The pros of jumping from the school was that my mom wouldn’t find my body. I didn’t want to do that to her. Some random kid at school finding my body while walking home from school seemed better. Another pro was, assuming it would work, hitting the ground would be painless. One second I would be alive, the next I wouldn’t.

It was now my lunch period. I didn’t go to the cafeteria. No one would notice I was gone. I found out what door to use to get to the roof. The only problem was that the door was locked. I didn’t want to steal a key or anything crazy like that. I just checked that door everyday to see if it would be unlocked. It was locked for weeks. But that summer Wednesday, it was unlocked. 

I was a bit startled by it opening. I had tried and failed so many times to open this door. But this time it had finally worked. The janitor had forgotten to lock the door. I stepped into a small room with stairs leading up to a second door. I walked up to open the second door at the top. The brightness of the summer sun hurt my eyes as the bright glare peeked out from the crack in the door I had made between the dark room and the outside.

I stepped out on the roof. Everything became very real suddenly. Was I really going to do this? I took of my jacket that I wore even in the summer. It stopped people from seeing the deep marks on my arms. It felt freeing. I couldn’t remember the last time I wore short sleeves outside. I stepped to the edge and looked down. It was a big drop. I saw some birds flying above. I outstretched my arms and put one foot over the edge.

There was no one to blame for this. I wasn’t bullied. My parents weren’t abusive. I didn’t want to get back at anyone. I simply wanted the pain to end. I felt weak. Jumping and ending it all at the time seemed like a powerful thing to do. Now I would finally be in control. I was taking the reins on life and ending it. I was strong. 

Long story short, I couldn’t do it. What can I say, I’m afraid of heights. I sat there on the roof and cried. I cried until my throat hurt and my eyes had run out of tears. How could think about doing this? I can’t leave my mom. I’m her only child. Without me she wouldn’t even have another kid to look after and love. I couldn’t do that to her. 

I went back down the stairs. It was strange to think that  I was previously trying so desperately to get into that room so I could die, yet I was now leaving alive. I walked downstairs to get to my class. A teacher was in the hallway. She asked where I had been and why I was coming down to my class from the fifth floor. I told her I didn’t feel good. She believed me because I looked like I had clearly been crying. I went to the nurse and said I had a headache. My mom came to pick me up. I told her nothing.

That’s why I think I need to confess this. I feel so terrible for going so far with my plan. I just needed to get it off my chest. I still haven’t told her and I don’t know if I ever will.

I am doing a lot better now. I’m taking anti depressants and went to a psych ward for my self harm. I have changed for the better. I am now 16 and my dad went to rehab. He has been clean of drinking for months. I have been clean of cutting for months. We are fighting together. I still have scars, but they tell my story. I still struggle but I can get through. I am a silent survivor.

Everyone else can fucking cope and I can’t and that makes me a fucking liability. I’m not worth it and I fucking know it. It still sucks to not be able to make myself get over it. I just want to reach inside my brain and make everything work so I could be like everyone else. I’m not gonna get any fucking better though. I’m not gonna be any different than I am now. Why don’t I fucking listen? I want to destroy myself for ruining my own life. No one is going to give a shit about me. I can’t control anything. I’m the human form of a runaway train.

(Yes this year by a friend of 3 years). I hated myself and my life. I finally gave up. Living wasn't worth it. I accepted I was going to die by suicide. I was ready. I had a plan to go Oct 2nd. 

Then one day at a low point my psychiatrist suggested I do ketamine since I have treatment resistant depression.  On top if paranoia, BPD, major depression and severe suicidal ideation.  

It's been one month since I started doing ketamine and I've had 2 suicidal thoughts in that time. That's it!! And I've stopped self-harming. I also quit drinking and the drug use. I'm finally free.

30,t3_dkq7m6,Remember who you were before the stuff that dimmed your shine,"Remember who you were once. The person that you were, that still lies deep down there, somewhere in you. 

You probably don't even know who you are right now. What your interests are, what your strengths are. Who is that person that you are seeing in the mirror right now? To me he seems very foreign. He is at best an empty hollow shell of who I once was. There is the body and the flesh, but there is nothing in the eyes. 

Find a picture of that old person and think about who that person was. What he wanted to achieve in life, what made him happy, what made him get up every morning. What was it about him that made other people love him?

You know that person is still there somewhere. A person that would laugh, that would look forward to something, that would appreciate the little things. The child that would count the days until their birthday, the teenager that would get a racing heart when seeing their crush, the young adult that knew that someday they would do something important with their life.

Remember who you were. Strive to be that person again. You were that person once, you are not a hopeless case. Don't think about the stuff that made you what you are now, you can't change it, you can't turn time back. But we all can do the best of it, with the time that's given to us now... 

Take your fucking life back from this shitty disease, take back control now, be the one who decides what your life will be from now on. 

Pick up the weights. Throw out the shitty food. Throw out the alcohol and drugs.

Throw out the people who you just know are not good for you. 

Go back to school or university if necessary, no matter how old you think you are.

Stop wasting your time with youtube and social media. Stop dreaming about other people's life while you're suppressing the real you deep inside.

Call the people that loved you back then and get back in touch. Show the world that they were right about you back then, when they still were around.

Don't wait for it. Don't wait for the miracle that will make everything good again. The only thing in the world that can bring you back from that hole is you. And you will. I believe in you.

37,t3_dkgh75,End of Depression,"Hi, 

I just wanted to share my progress to the world. 

I used to be a heavy druggie (only thing I wouldn’t do is meth crack heroine and pills)
I was really suicidal. 

I almost died this one time I tried to kill myself. I hung myself. Pooped peed turned purple and everything. But I didn’t die. I saw the light. I couldn’t see myself, but I knew it was my spirit floating in the middle of a really open grass field with tall pine trees on each end. As I tried to get closer and closer to the light, something strong pushed me away and then I opened my eyes. My boyfriend at the time took me off the noose right before I went to the light. 

I had many problems at home, school, and with myself. Never wanted to focus in school, I just wanted to focus on numbing the pain from trauma at home. I was involved in a lot of abuse. Emotionally, spiritually, and physically. 

I’m not trying to gain sympathy, I just want to share with you what happened to me in the past. 

Anyways, you get the point, it was bad. I was bad. I was hurting. It was not a fun time. 

Fast forward to 2019. 
I have not touched alcohol for over 5 years. 
I am sober. 

I have found someone that truly loves me for me. Well actually, he found me. 

I have converted from a crappy diet to an organic and wholesome diet. I try drinking raw fruit and vegetables juice every day. I also try to supplement to avoid vitamin deficiency. I find time to exercise. 

I found a great job that allows me to work from home and bring home enough money to cover all of our main bills. 

I lost so much weight. I went from 185 pounds to barely holding on to 115 

I let go of so much crap that was weighing my heart down. I lost so many friends, but I gained peace.

I found the strength to forgive my biggest enemy. I found the strength to forgive everyone that ever hurt me. I forgave my family for all of the abuse. Most importantly, I found the strength to forgive myself. 

I am actively trying to build a better relationship with everyone in my life. Great relationships are better than many relationships in my opinion. I only recently learned that lesson. 

I now have a family of my own. I love my life. I love everything about my life. I love my family. I am grateful for my family. 

For once in my life, I am looking forward towards my future. I feel... hopeful and eager to meet the rest of my family. 

I am so grateful for everything. 

I am glad I didn’t die in 2012. 

I’m glad I met the people I met. Even the ones that hurt me. 

Yes there are a lot of things I could have done better but the best thing about today is that I have the chance to try again.

I tried my best to adopt better habits and now I am seeing progress. 

My life is simple and quiet, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. 

Thanks for reading about to my progress.",depression

(she realized how serious it was and now im on meds, thankfully. love u mom) and a lot of the people who DO believe dont know what it and expect you to function normally.  there are also a lot who think im ""emo"" because of it??  i get being an adult with depression is hard as shit, but so is being a teenager.  i fucking hate my mind",depression

I have several mental issues and I am in debt to my ears and then some. needing to get four thousand dollars of work done on my teeth I can't afford even with a care credit dental card I have. I would be making payments of 50 a month for the rest of my life not counting the interest they will charge out the ahole.

I have no car and live in a very small dead beat town and have absolutely nothing here no uber, lyft, taxi, bus. I spent the past ten years trying to better my life, find a job, get my GED, get my own apartment, save for a car to live in as I moved to a better/bigger city. but all of those things have busted on me. couldn't get my GED, not smart enough. no one will rent to me, I don't get enough money or they want way too much or they want rental history which I don't have and can't use my aunt. The car I bought turned out to be a dud and a huge scam out of 2.5k dollars usd. Spent the past eight years trying to find a girlfriend and life partner and not a single woman was real with me or would give me a chance. spent ten years homeless. done everything I can to try to better myself and only end up in this huge ass hole I can't get out of and the water has filled to the top and I am drowning.

Tuesday my aunt and her son are leaving out of town and that is when I plan on ending it all and just being done with life. This isn't a cry for help, this isn't for attention. just posting because I have no where else and no one to say goodbye too who knows me and really cares.",depression

43,t3_dktxu1,I'm Getting rid of my Depression and going after Goal/Desire. And that's Officially by getting a Personal Comic Publishing Company.,"I'm getting really sick of this  unfair, cruel, boring,   ect. Full of   litter, angry  people, rude  drivers, and businesses.    There is no happiness to it.  No  magic.  Nothing.  Reality is extremely   boring and  limited. un-comparing to  how exciting,  mind-blowing,   magical, thrilling,  and overall  interesting our  imagination can be.

So in order to make my Real Life so much better, I'm officially getting a personal Comic book publishing company.   And start my career as a Storyteller. Because of that. I get to finally  express all of my overwhelming thoughts and dreams that are literally  trapped inside of my head. 

 And working with a  team to help  bring make  all of  my visions Reality. Poring all of my imagination and  thoughts  into these comics. If I run out of ideas during my Storytelling, I'm also gonna use a co-writer to help me as well.

 My  biggest  Comic series that I'll   be working is a Story that has been  inspired  from ""Spider-man Into the   spider-verse"". With Miles Morales  saying at  the end of the Film,   ""Anyone can wear the mask"". Indeed anyone  can wear  the mask. So that's   what this Story of mine is going to  resemble. 

This    series is called,  ""Spider-man The Adventures of Dave and the    Spider-squad"".  These Comics  will be amazingly cinematic. As if you'll    be watching a Movie inside of a  book basically. Each episode will have at least 200 pages in every book.

 The protagonist is    an  18 year old bullied  boy named  Dave.  Dave's personally and   emotions  is very similar to  mines.

 The    plot of this is Story  is ""One   morning, Dave had woken up from bed  to   see a small bite mark on   his  hand. Little did he know that he had  been   bite by a radioactive   spider.  Giving him amazing superpowers  that   allows him to become a   Reality  warper"".

Now    that  Dave had  become  a Reality warper. He has turned his Reality   into  a  complete  fantasy  world. Bringing all kinds of amazing things   from   his imagination  to  life. Dave had also brought some of his own     Spider-men and women to   life. specifically from anime. Such as ""Fate     Stay Night"".

In   this Film,   Dave   and the gang travels through different   Dimensions/Universes.   Mainly   from video games such as ""Dark souls III""   ""Legend of Zelda""   ""Fornite""   ""Metal gear solid"" and ""Final Fantasy"".   Fighting different   monsters   and enemy's from these Universes.

Some      of those anime  Spider-men/Spider-women will be from actual anime     shows  such as ""Soul  Eater"", ""Fate Stay Night"" and ""Comet Lucifer"".     Mainly  cause of all the  girls from these shows! Like Liz and Patty,     Kaon,  Sougo, Roman, Saber,  Rin Tohsaka Ect.

Rhino   will also be an extremely powerful villain/enemy in these Comics of   mine. So much so that he actually becomes an annoying  O.P. nuance that   Dave and the spider-gang constantly have to keep running into. It's basically an endless rivalry. And I'm actually gonna make an episode on that.

I      love anime  mainly cause of these beautiful girls! All of they're      Spider-woman suits  in my Stories will have holes in the center of      they're suits so all of  you readers would see they're belly buttons.

I       forgot to tell you that I'm also into feet. Basically like Quentin       Tarantino. There won't be a lot of feet scenes in my Movie series,   but     there will definitely be a good amount of them in a few number   of   scenes   throughout the Story.

The     stunts   and fight scenes will most definitely  the best thing's   about   these   Stories. Such as Dave and his crew jumping off extremely   tall   structures    with an overhead view to make it feel like you're    actually  there.

They will also   be  fighting  monsters from my own imagination. Such as a giant   beautiful  anime girl  wearing a crop-top. And a giant evil angry   Hitler. Both of  them can  shoot fireballs from they're mouths. They   will also try and  eat Dave and  the gang during the fight.

Anyway. That'll be my way of getting rid of my depression.",depression

45,t3_dkuial,"After several years of hiding and bottling how I truly feel, I finally told my mother that I need help.","I’ve been battling depression for around 14 years now, and it’s been a battle that mostly has been fought on my own. I have been to the doctor before when I was younger to seek help and they put me on Paxil and that was basically the end of it. 

I quit taking my Paxil shortly after because it made me feel very weird, uncomfortable and constantly drowsy. I told everyone I was fine without it and continued to hide how I really felt. That was almost 11 years ago. 

For the last few months I have been battling suicidal thoughts more than ever before to the point where I have come very close to doing it some nights. I then started not only thinking about suicide, but also just finding ways to harm myself. 

But today, I called off from work, went to my mothers house and finally told her that I think about suicide every single day and that I think I may also be suffering from derealization among other issues that I don’t feel the need to discuss with anyone but a psychiatrist. 

She didn’t freak out as bad as I thought she would. She then helped me apply for medical insurance and is helping me find a place to go and talk to a professional. 

I thought that it would feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders because I finally told someone how I feel, but in a way I feel more of the same or worse. But I’m moving in the right direction so as long as I hold out a little bit longer, I think I may end up okay one day.",depression

i wish there was just some type of sensory deprivation type thing, yknow? you just want to float, you want to be. just fucking be. but still have the ability and option to get out when you feel ready to. the concept of relief on both sides; loved ones knowing youre okay, and you not feeling that guilt and that anxiety at the thought of them constantly walking on eggshells.

will the sun ever come up? maybe. i dont know. but i hope it does, for all of you. the sun rays that is my sun are beginning to show. but they're terrified. terrified that if they do, something bad will come along and shove them back down.

happiness, i think, is a process. and it doesnt have to be all encompassing. it can be a subtle agreement between oneself to get up another day.

“I need to vent!” 
You lend an ear to listen. 
“I need advice!” 
You help them with their issue. 
“I need someone there for me!” 
You’re there for them. 

And all fucking day long they tell everyone else what a GREAT FUCKING FRIEND YOU ARE but as soon as you need something from them, they’re gone. “Sorry, I have to dogsit my lover’s dog.” 
“Sorry, I’m getting pussy that day.”
“Sorry, I’m too tired from work.” 
“Sorry, I already made plans.”
“Sorry, I didn’t think you’d want to come.” 

I’m sick of it. FUCKING SICK OF IT. 
Then when you actually show them that you’re not ok it’s suddenly all “you ok hun?” And “do you need to talk?” 

But it’s always too much. You’re just being too difficult, they say. They’re just trying to help, they say. They give little worthless self-help quips, like “it’ll get better!” And “believe in yourself!” 

Dollar store comfort at best. You’re not really worth their time. Your sadness makes them feel guilty so they want to quickly make you not sad so you stop making them feel guilty. 

Cherish your childhood friendships because that’s as good as it gets. Adult friendships are selfish, dramatic, and will leave you a bigger void than what you came in with. You will always be left behind. You will be lonelier than you are now. No one has the time or energy for our bullshit.

75,t3_dkq3j1,High functioning Autism,"It makes me miserable sometimes.

It’s just potent enough to fuck up your life, but just invisible enough that people expect you to act not disabled.

Example, I have sensory disorder with food where certain textures are so uncomfortable they make me wanna throw up. I can’t eat them. This includes many mushy textures including cooked vegetables. I love almost every vegetable cold,!crispy and raw, but I can’t eat them cooked. It sounds like a small deal. But it has massive repercussions.

Most obviously being seen as just picky and spoiled or something.
Think of how many meals include cooked vegetables of some kind.
I’d avoid dinner invites from people because I wouldn’t want to seem rude or deal with confrontation if I couldn’t eat the meal. At family dinners like thanksgiving I’d just grab a bun and meat, and other family members would all be perplexed at the tiny amount of food I grabbed. Think about what it’s like being an adult around other adults that seems mostly as an adult on the outside, but is picky like a child. People don’t see you as disabled, they see you as picky. Or maybe they do see me as disabled, or from their view retarded.

And that’s just one single example. There are tons of other little ticks and triggers I have that I’ve taken to calling “social landmines”

Another particular itch I have is evident in this very reddit post. My distain for name of my own affliction. “Asperger’s syndrome.” I cringe simply hearing it aloud. That’s why I’ve preferred to use the broader terms Autism, High functioning Autism, or ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), even if they do sacrifice some clarity.

My brain isn’t wired right. People (particular parents with autistic kids) who go around touting autism as a superpower, haven’t actually lived with this developmental disorder. Living in a world that was structured around everyone else’s brains. Not your own. Forcing yourself to adapt to a society that feels foreign. I often resign to hermiting instead.",depression

78,t3_dkvfu9,I feel stuck,"Hey, first time posting here. I don't know what else to do but tell someone about how I feel, maybe some type of hope or solution will show up for me.

To start off, I am a 19 year old girl attending university as a freshman. I am in my first semester two months in. I live in dorm, away from home which is about 3 hours away. Writing or expressing myself hasn't been the strong suit for me, so bear with me while I try my best.

I come from a Korean background, where college is a must for a future. This is what my parents, family and I have all grown up with. When I graduated high school, there was no question in me being sent to college, even though my therapist had suggested taking a year off. I have never struggled in high school, and gotten a high GPA and test scores to have a full scholarship ride to my university, so it would be dumb to give that up as well. I have been dealing with depression ever since I was about 12, when I lightly attempted suicide for the first time. I was never treated, as no one took it seriously. 5 years later I tried again, with more pills to be sure. This time, I spent a week in inpatient services, where I got on taking anti-depressants. As months went on the psychiatrist added more pills, so I take about 4 a night now.

Ever since I got to university, I have not been consistently taking them. Without my mom to grill me down to take my pills every night, I end up forgetting or becoming lazy. I honestly did not believe they were helping me much anyways, so I ended up not taking them at all after a while.

This is where I am struggling. I don't know if this is because I haven't taken my pills, or because college is becoming too stressful for me. All I know is, and I'm not sure how to explain all of this, but I have trouble getting up in the morning. I wake up, and I don't want to be awake. I have all these responsibilities, classes, work, all lined up for me and I don't want to do any of them. I just want to sleep, or play games and draw. Sometimes I can't tell if this is due to depression or me just being lazy. But one thing for sure, I feel that this is forever. I will always debate whether or not I can start my day in the morning. If I can make it to work or class. If I can do a simple task or not that anyone can do, like eating.

Just last night, I did not sleep because I couldn't, so I was surrounded by my thoughts. I saw a little thing, someone had blocked me on twitter when I did not do anything, and I broke. I thought about how much impact I had to people, how I just wanted to erase myself so I wouldn't negatively impact anyone else to the point they would block me. Sounds silly I know, but all of these thoughts swirled around me that I almost gave up. I almost dumped all of my pills at once. However with the little hope I had, I held on.

I guess I am just trying to say, I am struggling. I don't know what to do. I believe I can't do a simple thing as going to college like everyone else does. I am struggling to just stay alive every day, let alone classwork and assignments. If I can't graduate university, what good am I for? How will I make income? I can't live under my mom forever.

I feel ungrateful because not many people get the opportunity to go to college in the first place. It makes me feel pathetic and a failure, because everyone in my family expects me to do well and graduate with internships and a degree and a high-paying job.

I tried telling my mom about how I felt with college and how I wanted to drop out, how I was struggling but she disregarded it and told me to just graduate fast and then figure out if I want to take a break or not.

I also want to add this part. If I drop out of my university, I wouldn't be completely blind in my future. I have a passion for digital art, and I have been doing it for a while now. I have a following on twitter due to my art, and I am constantly working on expanding my art skills and my social media presence. I also stream on Twitch, mostly League of Legends and creative art. I am new, but I have been able to consistently grow it so far.

Although my college future seems helpless, I have all these other dreams and goals that I want to achieve, so I am thankful that I have that. I know I would have to work hard to achieve them, and I'm willing to do that. However knowing myself, I lose motivation fast and I might end up doing nothing for the rest of my life because I let depression swallow me. If I become lazy and not work for it, I will not achieve anything. At least with college, I'll have a degree to be safer.

I feel stuck. I am between wanting to have a good future for myself, and doing nothing in life forever. I don't know what to do. College is breaking me down. I don't want to die, I still have hopes for the future, but I don't want to exist through right now either. 

Every night I have to stop myself from trying to harm myself. Everyday it gets harder and more exhausting. Sometimes I don't want to breathe. Days go by and I am just existing. I feel empty like a shell.",depression
79,t3_dksw2z,I often get jealous at high functioning pychopaths!,"this world was tailored for the heartless and cold person. Which is people devoid of any empathy always rise up to the top! No proffession or no job in the world is suitable for a person with higher empathy overall. I wish I had the callousness and obvious narcissm of my father who manage to stake out a million dollar business and faces no guilt at all for the people he has cheat. I wish I inherited my mom's apathy where she says and do pretty vile things but she never feels bad for it or apologises for it. She basically made her self absent when her mom was dying and never showed up for funeral because ""I don't feel like it and hence I don't have to do it"" is what she embodies her whole life. She would smoke away indoors despite me suffering from bouts of asthma because ""I don't care"". And she sleeps the most peacefully at night without a care or concern in the world. Whereas I am deeply upset for days just because I mildy groped a guy who was anyways an asshole and consented to some sex during that time.

80,t3_dkveig,I feel so worn out.,"I'm only 14, but I feel like I'm 60. I can't explain how it feels. I'm grumpy and angry certainly, but I also have that rock bottom feeling where I end up just being an observer. A lost soul, able only to sadly smile at the happiness of others. I just sit in the back and watch, in a mix of solidarity and pain, or like hoping other people can be happy - while at once giving up on yourself - mixed with a bit of bitterness. When I had a PTSD-inducing acid trip - ironically trying to help with my depression - I hit rock bottom, and just sat in defeat; the void a relaxing backdrop to that awful downward spiral.  It was very much the most intense version of that feeling I've ever felt. I'm dying in quite a literal sense. It's even physically apparent. My joints are popping, my back is tense, and my shoulders can't drop or relax. I genuinely wish society just had a stigma-free 'give up' button but we don't even respect our citizens enough to let them die dignified; we have to live merely to appease those who think they can tell you when it's right and wrong for YOU to die; based on what they would feel. Or how about God? Even if he does exist, he isn't worthy of our praise. He raised us from death just to taunt us with it; with the tint of the void over our lives; we were destined to die. We're jesters to a cold, seething god.

Anyways, why not take a bath while you're still here. You deserve one. The thing that helps me most immediately is a semi-cold shower and some self care of that nature. It won't be much, but I find it's less of a fun thing to do and more of a release; like coming up for air while drowning. It's almost worse to come up for air as it feels like fuel to a dreadful desperation; another hard to describe feeling explained best by example; the cold shower one takes after a long trip in the wild, the shaky hands and the draining dirt and grime almost limitless on your body, the desperate need to stay in longer and keep yourself grounded to something you can feel, but also the pull to the warm bed that slips you quietly into the void. But it's worth a try - self care, that is - ... right? That's a hard question to answer. Do you want to choose that grounded reality? Or that float into the void? I'm inclined to say I hope you all choose reality. But I didn't, and I know you won't. All i have to say is good luck up there; in space, with only the diminishing warmth of your suit. I hope you'll find your way home.",depression

i'm currently a student in school, live in a major city, have had chronic depression (and probably other things) for several years now. it's been an ongoing sturggle, but im possibly at an all time low. last year i had close friends, spent all my time socializing, and i was more functional. this year i am very isolated, barely speak to people, and struggle to do my homework or basic tasks. i also don't care about my studies anymore, i still do my work but with minimal effort and idc if i even graduate anymore. all in all, i think school has made my life worse and i feel so trapped.

im strongly considering dropping out, but i have little money and i dont want to move back home (suburbs, really bad living situation with family, no car and would be isolated from peers). financially i think it would be smarter to stay in school (i would have to pay off loans in a  few months) but i dont want to waste money and continue to put myself in a bad situation while being here, and being more self destructive than i would have access to at home.

yes i am in therapy, but its free counseling from my school and isnt very effective. im just not trying to make any rash decisions while depressed, but i dont know if i can continue in school without losing my mind. thanks in advance

Therapy hasn't helped so far and I'll not be able to access therapy again for around a year, and so I'm trying antidepressants again. I have tried antidepressants in the past but I struggle to take medication and had side-effects so I've never been on them long enough to tell if they helped. 

My depression presents like running on autopilot, I don't feel enthused about anything and struggle to motive myself so I stay stagnant. I do get low moods and deal with regular suicidal ideation but it's not constant and can go in phases/waves. 

At the moment I've largely been avoiding low moods, but I can't tell if it's potentially down to antidepressants or just a normal stable phase. 

On top of that I struggle with alexithymia, this means I often struggle to identify between different negative emotions and often I won't notice I'm struggling until it manifests physically. So this may make it harder for me to tell if/when the antidepressants are working for me.

Everyday for over a year now ive had suicidal thoughts,detailed plans on how id do it and thinking about how it will affect everyone around me.Have tried OD'ing on paracetemol,but after two days i quit because i still had hope. Felt like i was making it up?

I constantly fidget with something in my hands for every possible second.

I make very blatantly obvious mistakes that are often caused by not listening/reading something correctly or i didnt focus on it enough.

I keep forgetting things and get carried away.

My mood basically has three states:

A:Extremely depressive,lasting for a couple weeks/months

B:Extremely motivated,ambitious,believing i can do anything and everything will be fine and im just making it all up.Become extremely reckless and self-destructive

C:After a mental breakdown i completely emotionally numb myself and am basically an emotionless shell.

Im constantly tired without doing anything

I hate making decisions and get really anxious when doing them

When i feel depressed i feel a lot of guilt,worthlessness,helpless about myself,blaming myself about everything.Cant do anything and just lay /sit in bed thinking about things in my life doing nothing.

Insomnia.Quite contradicting with me wanting to sleep all day but somehow i cant sleep too.I want to sleep but i dont want to sleep.Whichever urge is stronger i pick it.Often times i simply cant sleep because i feel like i dont deserve to sleep and have to be productive but i dont actually  do anything with the added hours.

I distance myself from everyone.I cant determine if i'm delusional and people actually like me, or i'm right and no one does.I keep asking myself whats wrong with me.I feel like every friend i have fakes it and is just talking to me because they dont want to seem rude.

Absolutely no self-confidence/self-esteem

Physically punish myself for any mistake i do.

These are a  couple of things that i've noticed.I don't know if i actually have an issue or multiple,or i'm just a typical moody teenager that's too lazy to study.I don't know what to do at this point",depression
106,t3_dkup2g,I feel like I wanna commit suicide,I’m 13 and I like this girl and every time I see her I lighten up. But when she’s around other dudes I just feel empty. like she’s what’s keeping me from committing suicide.,depression
107,t3_dkunp8,Sucidial thoughts.. but not really?,"So, recently I've been very upset about my physical appearance, I won't go into detail but I hate it. I only feel better when I think about death. It's like a bit of relief, you know. A bit of, ""Just a little longer and it's over"". It's gotten to the point where I think about killing myself everyday, all through out the day. I want to go stand on the edge of a roof or bridge just to see how I feel. I am very sad and get envious when others are happy or out with their friends despite me hating people. Although, I'm pretty sure it's just hormones as I'm a fairly young teenager. I needed to tell someone this, thank you.",depression
108,t3_dkt3k3,I'm so sick of waking up cold.,"Its been 510 days since the one woman that cared about me left me because I took her for granted. Lately I find myself thinking more and more about how it felt to wake up next to someone else and just how lonely it really feels to wake up in an empty bed. Everyone keeps telling me it was an abusive relationship, and to an extent I think that's true but I also think I may have inflated some details when explaining my side of it, just for the dopamine shot of having a friend agree with me. Just when I think it's getting better, just when I finally think I've found someone else, just when I finally feel like I can move on, I get hit with the ol' ""I'm not really looking to date right now"". If you've made it this far, thanks for pretending to care. I appreciate it.",depression

111,t3_dkukl0,Rant ... Crying in a hospital bed,"Last night I attempted suicide. My husband found me on the bathroom floor. Called 911 and had to do compressions on me because I was barely breathing I came to eventually but was in and out of consciousness. In the ER they gave me lorazepam and morphine for my chronic pain. I don’t remember any of it. I woke up in the hospital and here I still am ...

I feel like this is my rock bottom. And I don’t know how to get out of it. The main reason I’m depressed is because I have an undiagnosed medical issue, with the biggest problem being chronic excruciating pain. My new doctor is amazing and said he’d monitor me here instead of admitting me to the psych ward. He acknowledged that my depression is a result of this unknown illness, and said he is going to help me find out what’s wrong. He will treat the pain while also trying to stabilize my mood. It will still be a long process. 

The thing is ... I don’t know how to keep fighting. I’ve been in lain for over 5 years, depression for 15 and have had shitty treatment throughout. I’m glad I found this new doctor, but I’m so beat up from the past. Every day is a constant struggle. I want to be happy, or even just neutral. But that whole black dog thing is true, he’s weighing on my 24/7.

Anyway just needed to rant. I can’t fall asleep because they need the blinds open to check that I’m ok. And I’m right by the main desk so phones are ringing along with the staff working/talking. I’m a terrible sleeper as it is. 

Fuck. Sorry for being an eeyore I just can’t take this shit anymore. Thanks to everyone who posts and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Depression is hell on earth and it’s exhausting.",depression

I was able to socialize with the parents and play with the kids. It was a big win for me!! Last yr for my son's bday I felt like I completely ruined it because my anxiety was so high i had to go to my room away from everyone and it made me feel so low so this yr I'm just so proud that I did it, it's such a big step.",depression
116,t3_dkuh70,My chances of getting better are astronomically slim.,"This is not hyperbole. I don't see any realistic way I'm getting out of my situation, especially not before it's too late.

I'm supposed to be hearing about a possible therapy appointment sometimes in the near future, but it could easily be another month, or longer if they tell me that there aren't any available. 

But even when or if I go back to therapy, I already know that's not going to fix me. I know that, with about 95% certainty - I will just be told the same shit as before. ""You just need confidence."" ""You need to accept things as they are.""  
Because therapy doesn't tackle your issues. It just tells you to shut up and deal with them. Therapy won't get me out of the environment that's driving me insane or change the body that I hate to live in; I'm not even sure that a therapist will help show me the way to fixing things. Last time my therapist gave up on me when her ""just try to think positively"" talk didn't work. I'm not expecting anything better this time.

But let's pretend for a moment that money and accessibility was no object. Even then, if I could do exactly what I liked, I don't know if I could recover. I don't know if the technology even exists to help me. Honestly, I think only something along the lines of a supernatural miracle could make me happy, and as much as I want to believe that something will happen, I've never seen any evidence of such things in my whole life.

I just want a way out. At this point I'll do anything. Even if I have to join some weird obscure cult and start sacrificing live goats, whatever, honestly, I just want to escape this nightmare. And if I can't get out then I don't think I can go on living.",depression

119,t3_dkub78,Don’t know what to do anymore. [long rant],"Sooo I have been depressed(not officially diagnosed but I’m pretty sure I am) for about 3 year now since I was 14. Im a guy and turned 17 a month or so ago. At first I had thought it may just be a phase or some difficult part of my life. But after all this time I have figured out that this is my life. 

I don’t know what all to rant about really but I am alone all the time. You may think I’m being dramatic but I’m literally alone like 99%of the time. Not by my accord. People just act like I don’t exist. Granted I’m quiet but I’m still here. You can still act like I’m here and acknowledge me. That’s the one things that hurts me the most. It feels as though over these three years people have noticed me less and less. I have no one to turn to. And I just want someone to be able to count on to be there, to make me feel like things are okay in my messed up life. 

I’m also sad. Now I have really good days too but those are very far and few in between. I haven’t really been truly happy in months. Yeah I smirk or laugh or whatever but I haven’t had that overwhelming feeling of happiness. I just feel like I’m here. This emotionless robot. I wake up, go to school, go to work, come home and sleep and repeat the process. I see people progressing in life and it just bums me down even more. I feel lost and like I’m not in the right place at all. I have no motivation or ideas or anything anymore. I have started to view myself in an even more negative light thinking I’m fat and ugly and that no one wants me. Cause I’m a senior and never been in a relationship. I’ve been rejected over and over which doesn’t help this. 

And I know that if anyone actually reads this they may say that I need help and I know I probably do. But it’s hard being a guy and being depressed. The stereotype around it makes it about a 1000 times harder to come out about it. Idk it just makes me feel weak. And not only that, but one day I just started feeling depressed. It just happened. I don’t even have a reason for it. I have a good home and health. Like what’s wrong with me.

I used to be able to manage things with music but now that’s not working as well anymore and I don’t know what to do. Overall I just wanna feel happy, wanted, and like I belong. I haven’t in a while and I don’t think I will for a long time. I’ve already kinda written other things but idk. Anyways, thank you if you actually read this all because I doubt anyone actually will cause I have no one but I appreciate you at least taking the time to even read this. I just had to put everything out somewhere.",depression
120,t3_dkqlml,i have a secret,"  

I have a secret. I am bipolar. There are times when I feel like lying down, buying a shotgun, and blowing a hole in my face. Other times my mind is screaming at me, demons from the past whether or not they should exist just leeching my day away. Occasionally I get a break, everything is clear and I step forward through the manic state. Accomplishing and working towards a lot. 

I have no reason to hate myself, in fact I work really hard on loving myself. And for the right reasons. Actually, really proud of that. I think the worst things in my life are in my head. Something I can’t escape ever. Bonded to me for the rest of my life. Maybe I’m the demon.

Here’s the thing. Mental health is a life long struggle. It never goes away you can only fight it. I want to help other people, I want it so when im down or depressed or whatever I can look and say I did something good. I fixed some problem.. I am doing the right thing and not the wrong thing. 

I’m working on myself, so I can help other people do it too.

123,t3_dku5ea,Agonizingly lonely,"I have social anxiety and some PTSD and have been very isolated for the past couple of years. I'm 21 and I'm going to university in the US but I'm from the Caribbean and am here without my family. I've had a really had time making friends, and they few friends I do have aren't great, we don't necessarily have much in common and a few have become very distant, not even responding much when I try to reach out when I'm feeling especially suicidal. I have automatic suicidal thoughts all day every day, and my life right now feels very up in the air and unsure and I don't have anyone to talk to. When I try to reach out to friends they're too busy to respond. I guess I'm just posting here since I don't know what else to do. I'm not close with my family but my parents are in town because I got baker acted recently because my chronic suicidality was worrying my treatment team, but that pretty much got me kicked out of the partial hospitalization program I was in because they say I'm not improving enough and want me to go to a residential program, but I've been looking into those and they're prohibitively expensive, mostly geared towards substance abuse, and are few and far between. 

I guess my point is that things are pretty shitty right now, and I'm so incredibly lonely that it hurts. 

Also, I'd appreciate some lighthearted podcast recommendations; I listen to a lot of true crime comedy, which isn't the best for my mood and distorted thinking. I listen to Reply All but I find it can get heavy sometimes.",depression

129,t3_dkqe9q,need an ssri but terrified of weight gain,"hello everyone ! i was treated for severe depression in early high school (i'm 20 now) with a prescription of zoloft and wellbutrin. being put on that medication changed my life and made me incredibly social, outgoing, and passionate. it also made me gain enough weight to be mildly overweight for the first time in my life (doesn't sound bad, but it fucked me up a lot).

4 years into that prescription i was feeling so good, to the point that i thought i didn't need the zoloft anymore. i went cold turkey on the zoloft (stupid, i know) and stuck with wellbutrin. i began losing all the weight which, in turn, developed into a severe eating disorder with which i still struggle with. unfortunately, with the weight went all my confidence, passion, and socialization capability. i did not connect the dots between getting off that medication and the massive dip in my mental health until recently.

i think the zoloft is what really helped me in that regard, while the wellbutrin (which i'm still on) just keeps me from wanting to kill myself. i'm currently at a low in my life for social anxiety, and i desperately want back what being on an ssri gave me. i believe it helped enable my passion, creativity, etc.

due to my eating disorder and dysmorphia issues, my priorities are skewed. i'm *currently* at a healthy weight, but still unhappy with it, and trying to lose. i'm so, so scared of gaining back that weight even though i need the positive effects from zoloft at this point in my life. i'm desperate for happiness but scared shitless at the thought of weight gain. anyone have any ideas on how to combat the weight gain side effects that go along with ssri's? is there a way to avoid it completely? thank you ! &lt;3 (diagnosed w/ major depressive disorder and GAD, btw)",depression

So this continued for all of 2017 and 2018 and it took a toll on my mental and physical health. I became depressed and I gained a few pounds because of all the stress, but I would always put on a fake smile and pretend to be happier than I was to them because I would worry about them and everyone around me. This year in early October I was suspended from school because I had hurt another kid. So I had to talk with my counselor and he principal, and because of this I had finally broke and told them everything. They told me that they would have to tell my parents everything to. I was so scared because I never wanted them to learn about it but I couldn’t stop it. I told my mom and my dad everything that I felt and at first they were speechless but then they said that they would help me and that they loved me. I felt lighter and a little less scared but the feeling didn’t go away. It never left and now I’m sitting here writing this post and still feeling like I failed them and myself because I couldn’t stop them from worrying about me.

Little background , I have strong allergies to perfume and bleach and they can cause me to go into anaphylaxis. Work is aware and although they claim to try to “accommodate” me they will not post any signs or institute a “fragrance free” policy like other similar medical offices. Last year after a reaction I ended up in the ER and work would not let me back “for my own safety” and after getting a lawyer involved it took 3 months before they allowed me back, all going unpaid.

My new problem is that I had another reaction last week, this time caused by pure negligence. All my coworkers are aware of my condition and have been educated and one of them decided to spray large amounts of perfume in a common area without any warning. I immediately went into anaphylaxis and was taken by ambulance to an ER. 

Occupational Health is once again claiming that they cannot guarantee a “safe” environment for me and are now looking for ways to fire me. 

I need your help and advise, do I have any legal rights to keep my job? Or get compensation? I am so worried that if I loose this job I won’t get another due to my health issues.  I get so angry because this was pure stupidity done by a coworker who knew better, not a client who came into the office with no knowledge of the risk.

In your own butthole you pick how messy it gets and in what way, you keep clear/clean what you need to to keep functioning so the mess does not appear to effect you much and once you feel better you can clean the less essential parts.

This is for anyone who needs to hear it","Hi, my name is Savanna, I am 13 years old. Today I will be sharing my experiences with anxiety that slowly sank into depression. But, first I will give you guys a little bit of back round first. When I was a baby I grew up in a small simple neighborhood in the suburbs with two wonderful parents. But, around the age of two my parents decided to move to a bigger part of the suburbs. We had our house built, so we had to stay at my grandparents house for a bit. And since I didn't remember to much of my other home, It was very easy two settle in. The first eleven years at that house was great, I thought nothing could ruin it. But that's where I was wrong. Through 2017 and all of 2018, I noticed some changes in my father. I thought nothing of it, because my mom said he got depressed sometimes. I felt terrible for my father, but I didn't have the courage to speak to him about it. One day in January of 2018, My father left us. Now I don't want to get into detail about what happened, but I was heartbroken by his decisions. I was heartbroken that he lied to me my whole entire life. at that time I already had anxiety, but this just made it worsen and worsen. I had a lot of friends at the time, However this was the last year at my school next year I would be enrolled in online school. And quite frankly, I was very scared to lose my friends, due to school. my anxiety and my fathers actions. But, things were far from over. All that anxiety quickly fell into a mild  depression, and I was losing it. I started to have more fights with my mom, to not eating, to insomnia. And even some nights I was lucky enough to cry myself to sleep, so I wouldn't have to stay up thinking about stuff. By the time I hit 7th, my anxiety was through the roof. And months passed and my mom started noticing, so she booked an appointment for me. My therapist was nice and helped me a little bit, but I still kept a lot inside. I don't want to sadden you guys with the details, but the next 11 months were a mess. Now I am currently in 8th grade and its been almost 2 years since my father left. I am still depressed and suffer from anxiety today, and do cry most nights still. But, I just wanted to say to anyone out there, you are loved , you have a purpose, you are beautiful beyond belief. You're story's not over, it's just beginning.

P.S. Hey guys, it's SavvK I really hope this post helped someone who is going through a lot right now :) There's always a light at  the end of the tunnel.",depression

(I was a delivery driver for years and am confident in all my driving skills so when she yelled I like... lost confidence for that split second). It was such a weird feeling. I didnt tell until.she calmed down from the highway traffic. My heart just like.... literally sank and it did not stop for a good 10 minutes. I couldn't stop thinking of her getting hurt or facing her family of her death. Quite extreme but that is what I thought. Once all was relaxed and easy going traffic wise, I did what my therapists told me to do. Speak my mind and dont lose my temper. I told her not yell or scream when I'm turning lanes because it have me a little fright. It was not a pleasant feeling. It wasnt her fault. She knows I rarely know my emotions or know what I'm feeling, so she had no idea of knowing I'd internally freak out. Was it fear that I felt? Or was it just me being startled by her yelling?",depression

I can stay in here 24/7 and be content. I used to have such big dreams and aspirations. Unfortunately years ago I started using meth a lot, then heroin and whatever else I could get my hands on. During that period of addiction, I ruined my life. I stole from my friends. I stole from my gf at the time. I would shoplift to survive. I broke into storage units to steal stuff to sell. I would sleep around with meth head chicks. And I racked up a bunch of warrants. I’m too scared to go to prison so I have just abandoned everything and am on the run. My girlfriend knows this and understands and accepts. I love her so much, without her I would’ve ended my life already. But I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t go 50 years like this.

I don't have a reason to live. There's nothing in life I want anymore. Anytime I'm happy it's just a reprieve from my endless suffering. I can't ever just stop and relax. If I do that then my brain likes to throw every embarrassing moment at me and it doesn't stop until my mind occupies itself with suicide.

I'm white, but I have a giant nose, somewhat curly hair, massive eyes and eyelashes, thick lips, excess fat buildup in my cheeks, and a weak chin. I can't even grow out a mustache properly, and my beard looks like shit. Because of how much I hate the way I look, I never bother making friends or getting with any girls. I've been called a Jew over a dozen times (even though I'm not Jewish and have no Jewish blood), and I've been called short many times as well. My nose is definitely the feature I hate the most about myself, it is absolutely massive and looks like fucking shit. My family members have also pointed out my massive eyes and eyelashes. My shitty dad was the one who gave me those horrendous genes, and now I'm just stuck with them.  I also have astigmatism, so I have to wear glasses or contact lenses in order to see pretty much. In high school, I either ate like shit or didn't eat at all. I also hardly got any sleep in those years. That and coupled with my dad's shitty genes, my body has the appearance of a little boy. I made a plan to save up for plastic surgery so I can try and correct my face. By doing that, maybe I can gain at least an inkling of self-confidence in myself. However, it is expensive. If everything goes according to plan, then I'll have enough money to get the surgery. But that may only be enough to get half of the procedures I want.

My problem is this my emotions are literally all wrong. For example when I am happy alot of times I cry uncontrollably which isn't often given I am rarely happy. When we have sex I get massively depressed right after orgasm and I feel lonely, sad and a crushing depression. When I something is breathtakingly sad I feel numb or I will start to laugh. Nothing is seeming to match up at all. I love my wife more than anything so it has nothing to do with her. I was just wondering if maybe there is a chemical release causing this? I do not want to say anything to her or to my therapist in front of her because I do not want her to think sex is off the table. She doesn't deserve to be in this mess with me.

I am just confused as to what is going on here. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and multiple other phobias on top of physical ailments one of which is killing me so that raises the stress as well.

171,t3_dkt144,Depression is destroying my ability to date.,"[M22] 
I apologise for the length of this post, I haven't vented about this to anyone yet, but it feels like it's time to get it out. I am struggling. A year ago (in two days), a girl I was really REALLY interested in broke things off super abruptly. I would've otherwise been totally fine with it, I've gone through it a few times and it stings at first but I get over pretty quickly. But this girl was different, something about her just reeled me in from the instant I met her. I suck at keeping conversations with people in general, but it was so easy to talk to her, as if we had already known each other forever. I seriously thought that I had found my soulmate in this girl.

We texted each other for a couple weeks before deciding to meet each other one day on a whim, and I should stress that it was on a whim. I had been recently kicked out of my dad's house, I was in a ridiculously horrible depressive state because of it and she was being super supportive during that whole ordeal, basically the only thing giving me hope. She made me so happy man. There was one day that we were both free, which was unusual because she worked a looooooot, she knew what I was going through and wanted to come hang out for a bit. So of course, me being super emotional, I was ecstatic. 

During the ""date"", I was trying so hard not to be awkward and I think it came across. I made her laugh a lot, we held hands as we walked through an arboretum (which I might add wasn't that sightly as it was Autumn and cold), and then we went out to get some food. But, I think my emotions messed everything up, because I kept trying to be mushy and lovey dovey with her, which is very uncharacteristic of me to begin with. Now, mind you, I was NOT bring forceful at all. It's funny because why the hell would anyone kiss on the first date? Like seriously dude? Anyways, date goes fine, she drops me off and I text her goodnight and thank you, to no reply.

This part is still hard for me to face. I usually avoid these memories. She doesn't get back to me until the next morning, which felt like weeks because of course I couldn't sleep. I was thinking the worst possible things, making excuses as to why they probably didn't happen, that maybe she was stuck in traffic, fell asleep when she got home (she did live a little far) y'know, the run-around. So she texts me, and said that something about me completely threw her off, and that she didn't want to have a romantic relationship with me. I immediately knew it was because I was being a little too mushy with her, but she insisted it wasn't, that it was just her. By nature, I just can't argue with someone's feelings. If that's how they feel, I have no choice but to respect it. But this. This absolutely destroyed me. It still does one year later. This was all during the worst week of my entire life. I got kicked out, I was sleeping on the floor of a friend's house, I got sick because of it, and then this. A day after that went down, I fled to New York and stayed with my mom for 10 months to escape the bad energy.

I tried out the 'just friends' thing with the girl for a couple weeks while I was up there but of course it didn't work. I just couldn't stand myself. I couldn't stand the feelings I had (and kinda still have) for her. Everything reminds me of her, every scent reminds me of her, every song, every movie, everything. My depression turned me into someone else. I became pretty unbearable and we haven't talked since. Except for a couple days after Christmas, when I attempted to reach out just to say thank you, because honestly the decision to move up north actually changed my life for the better. She shut me down immediately.

Every time I think about her I feel so bad about myself. I feel like a complete idiot. She's still in my head dude. Her initials might as well be carved into my aortic valve. Any time I even think of pursuing anything I'm interested in or passionate about, I get clotheslined with this feeling of ""yeah right, you'll never get off your ass and do anything anyways because you're not capable of being loved, and you know that's what you crave."" Since then, I haven't been able to spark an interest in any girl I meet, and I worry that my emotions ruined my ability to date for possibly the rest of my life, at least for the next several years. She's the only face that comes up when I think about love, and it sucks. It stings. She was the closest thing to a soulmate that I had ever experienced. I feel like I can't get out of this hole.

The privileged stay privileged and the poor stay poor. Life is probably the most unfair thing that humans go through. You either keep going as painful as that is or die trying. Nobody is about to help during this time. It's a dog eat dog world. I'll happily say don't confide in anyone. It'll bite you in the arse. People who know about my deeper issues have made a mockery out of it. This creates skepticism and trust issues. Eventually develops into pessimism and apathy then depression. Male with depression? Well you're in luck! You now have a society which hates you. They'll tell you to man up and tell you depression is what millennial snowflakes develop. People are absolutely rotten. I'm still a 16 year old baby and I'm already seeing the world for what it is during the ""best time of my life"". I fear the future, it's uncertainty is enough to put someone in a panic.

I'm just hoping the change in location helps since most of my mental health breakdowns are closely tied to my close family members and the fact there are no resources here.

189,t3_dkpy10,The worst part of life is living life,"Hey, im 15 and what im about to say will make some of you look at this post and think ""what are you on?"" as people (teenagers) in real life just disagree and have a cynical opinion about me.
In my opinion being an adolescent is the worst part of life.
I believe in my own form of solipsism (the philosophy of ones mind only existing in their own reality). We all live in an imagined reality based around fictitious entities.
For example religious people only believe in religion because the homo-sapiens they decended from believe in it because it gives them a sense of meaning and they want a leader to follow so they don't wander meaninglessly through life. You can't promise a chimpanzee that it'll go to a heaven full of food and luxuries after it dies as it has taken advantage of environmental variation and only cares about itself and it's own survival. It's not narcissistic it's nature! On the other hand if you wrote a book and call it ""The religion of food"" and millions even billions of homo-sapiens read it and believe what it says it will allow all of them to have one thing in common, (food heaven) and be able to co-operate effectively. I believe religion was created as forager bands of sapiens were 100-150 and they needed more people to co-operate. Our cognitive abilities is why chimpanzees are locked up in cages in zoos and we are at the top of the food chain and are yet the smartest but dumbest creatures to exist on earth.

This is solely down to the homo-sapiens cognitive ability. Nothing actually exists, it's all retained information from the archaic beings before us. 
Words were invented to communicate as the  homo-sapiens cognitive abilities allow us to. If we look at ardipithecus ramidus (who later evolved into Australopithecus afarenis) they had no verbal ability and were hunter-gatherers, depending on their environment to survive. Of course evolution is a theory and potentially doesn't exist, it's the most logical way all life was able to exist on earth. 
We are all brainwashed by excessive consumerism  due to the influence of others, our emotions always open the door to a positive or negative future. I honestly despise the world more than the amount of hatred the word depise connotes. The world and the blind ones surrounding me are my worst enemies in day to day life. Im mostly depressed by the fact the law controls me using a broken system. I hate being interior due to age, this is something which won't forever plague me but no matter what I'll still be inferior to the people at the top of the social structure and the hierarchy. No-one is ever good at something as theres always someone better. 
My ideology about existence and my actual life just depresses me. I don't see the point in existing if I'm being told by some bullshit book some bloke wrote many many years ago in parliament. I know they ensure the safety of the citizens and prevent anarchy but some laws are just stupid. I mainly despise the age of consent law as it prevents us homo-sapiens from conducting what we were born to do until we have been alive for long enough. A successful species is a species that passes down the most DNA and has the most copies of itself, if i can't reproduce, i'm not fulfilling my purpose on this earth which renders me useless. 
I'm a useless being attaining information for no reason with no purpose; only to be enslaved to work in places and for companies which only exist in peoples minds to obtain pieces of paper with fake digits on them. The whole thing is a social construct and a brainwashing technique as archaic humans invented money for enslavement as earths earth's natural resources are now encapsulated even though they should be freely available for survival. Im a stat in a failing system which will in the end plauge the world under nuclear radiation then the next stage of humanity will begin. The survival of everything will always depend on fictitious entities like states (eg UK, USA, Canada) and the corrupt people who allegedly run them with more fictitious entities. Reality is fake and it depresses me as i have no self worth as i know im worthless to everyone and everything and no-one listens to me when i tell them this they all just look at me weird and cling to their imagination. Not to mention im also an outcast to society. My kind is shunned, but im fine with being hated, at least im not brainwashed. I usually get bullied for not following gender stereotypes as i have long ginger hair which i like to straighten and look after so it goes all fluffy. Life just ain't good as i know that age doesn't exist, no one is an age, but all these ""adults"" are brainwashed too by the system and it actually pisses me off seeing 50 year olds still believing in rubbish then claim that they are wise. I hate the law and im scared im gonna get thrown behind bars or thrown into a mental hospital one day too. Im also afraid of myself as im a homo-sapien, it's scary existing. I have no purpose. i want death so bad. Politics just makes me more depressed and nothing will cure it as existence is my plague.
Age restricted products make my blood boil the most as i know age don't exist and those products were created using the earths resources WHICH IS SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO AS I FUCKING LIVE HERE IN THIS SHITTY DEMOCRACY.
Age restricted venues also get my blood boiling to superhuman levels as this is a democratic society i should be able to roam wherever i want (excluding peoples houses) it's bullshit how i can drink as much as i want at home due to the law stating anyone over the age of 5 is allowed to drink as much as they want in a private property but not in public. Like what? You might aswell let them buy alcohol out of their own free will if they are allowed to drink it at home.

I just thought id write this as any others might have similar ideology. I love being an outcast and being unethical. Im the most hated guy in my school because im ""mental and weird and a satanist"" (the last one is because of my love of heavy metal) people fear me, but i fear them more; i fear myself the most. 

Thank you for taking time out of your day to peer into my mind. I appreciate it.

Like I know that people my age say that they are depressed just cuz they go through normal teenage hormones, but I have actually been diagnosed with depression. My parents don't think much of it because they think I am getting better but I am just not expressing anything, as it is not my character to do so. I guess I should just say that I am an introverted person. I relate to the BBC Sherlock because I am a master at deduction and am arrogant, lonely, and depressed. I only have about 2 best friends because I isolate my self from society and people. So yes I am a high functioning sociopath. But a few months back, I met this girl who changed everything for me. She was a misfit like me, and I thought that for once someone truly cared for me, as I go through family trouble and am isolated and alone. She really brought the good from the arrogant careless me. We grew closer and closer, until one day she just randomly told me that she's had a boyfriend for a while now. And that just broke me. From the person who never shows his true self and never shows love to anyone, is now heartbroken. I thought that she was different. Now I know that there are going to be people telling me that why are you depressed over a young teenage relationship? But thats not the point. The point is that she was the only person who really cared for me and was always there for me. She was the person I of all people loved in terms of real true friendship.

We’ve been friendly for awhile as we both go to the same school and have mutual friends but had never really talked, we ended up just driving out to a park and sitting in a field with blankets and talking for hours and hours, there was never a weird moment and we stayed until after dark. It turns out we have a lot in common, we talked about our families and problems and boys that have hurt us and it felt so good to spill like that. I haven’t had that much trust in someone in a long time. After that we went and got dinner together and we ended up falling asleep at her place, I don’t want to jinx it or anything but I feel like we really clicked.

209,t3_dksi2m,"Stalling, Sputtering, and I’m Just So Tired","I’m turning 30 years old and I’ve been out of work for three years. 

I nearly make ends meet doing freelance writing work and research contracts, some fun, most of them not. I was, at one point, a journalist and then a speechwriter, though my former employers relied on me more for crappy ghostwritten op-eds. For the most part, my portfolio under my own name is full of glorified clickbait though I did have one article published in a national magazine two years ago that I’m not sure I really believe in anymore.

I have two meh diplomas from Ivy League universities including a useless master’s degree in writing. I wrote a novel no one wanted to publish, and in my more productive moments, I’ve taught myself Python and OSINT research practices in the attempt to diversify my skill set.

Over the last three years, I have applied to so many jobs in so many industries across the United States and Europe I’ve lost count. I have made it through multiple rounds of interviews on more than one occasion only for the potential employer to lose interest. About a year ago, my window for a potential dream job— historical writing with a major newspaper— came and went in a 5-minute phone call with a 23-year-old recruiter who did not technically work for the publication in question. (Of all the disappointments, I still think about that one the most as I have no idea what I did wrong). I taught myself math again for the GRE and applied to doctoral programs out of desperation only to be turned down from every one. Of late, I’ve started an antiquarian book business (the only other field I ever trained in, because I’m so fucking “smart”) but its proving to be more of an expensive hobby than anything resembling a profitable business. 

I’m married, and although its arguably the only thing I have going for myself, that is also falling apart. My wife works from home and I suspect the proximity combined with our choice to move from New York City to a sequence of increasingly rural areas has created a level of codependency that has also, ironically, impeded our ability to communicate with each other. I no longer feel heard or particularly appreciated, and I don’t think she’s the same woman I married. Of course, it’s possible I am the one who has changed, as I think she at one point actually liked my company and conversation. Now we just seem to fight or ignore each other.

I feel trapped in the rural portion of the mountain west in which I have found myself, an arrangement that is stretching further and further than I initially agreed to. It’s beautiful here, but I know no one and my life consists mostly of spending time with my wife and her elderly parents. I think I’ve lost the majority of the friends I once had due to time and distance away, things which seem not to bother my wife who apparently never cared much for friends to begin with. 

I keep thinking about just packing up my car and driving back east, but I do not know what I’d do once I got there or how I’d afford to stay. All I know is that being here is not helping. I’ve watched the seasons go from summer to fall to sudden winter through this same window, and the only thing I’m certain of is that I’m wasting time.

I feel isolated and alone, and like I have spent so much time and energy on efforts I have nothing to show for. Every job listing depresses me, and every time I apply to something and don’t hear back it just gets worse. At this point, as my unemployment has (unintentionally) turned from one year to three, I do not know who would want to hire me or even what I want to do anymore. The word “content” has started to turn my stomach but it does seem like it might be the only option I have left.

I like books, I like research, I like history, and I like ideas, but I don’t like myself. I’m not sure I ever did.

I don’t think I’m going to kill myself but I’m not sure anymore. I have PTSD leftover from childhood stuff and tried three times before I turned 21. At some point, I concluded it probably wasn’t a good idea, though I mostly rest that belief on not wanting to hurt my mother and a few nebulous metaphysical foundations, my faith in which is dwindling along with my faith in myself. I’m not certain, at this rate, that I won’t at some point just get drunk enough to do something stupid, or get so tired I get into an “accident” as a workaround. I’ve been fantasizing about it more and more and caught myself writing what was effectively a suicide note the other day.

I’ve made many mistakes in my life, squandered opportunities, and failed to live up to potential others saw in me, or said they did. I could blame the lack of mentors or advisors in my life, but my own naiveté and stupidity seem more likely culprits. I’m not sure where I went off the rails, or which was the first mistake that lead me here, but I’m not even sure I believe I can make things better anymore. I have no one to blame but myself.

I don’t know if this is the right place and I don’t know what I even want anyone to say. Whatever it is, let me have it.

I might delete this later.",depression
210,t3_dkshi6,Thinking about giving up a lot lately,"Sometimes I think about hurting myself. I don't really want to die. I just get tired of always feeling the same. Feeling the pain of my existence that seems impossible to fix. Pretending to be ok. I can have a great day/night, but once I'm alone again the same thoughts come flooding back. Thoughts of being a failure and not being good enough for anyone. Losing myself in my OCD or having another panic attack. Wondering if I'll be able to really beat my mental problems even just stop being depressed.

Sometimes I ask people to hangout just so I'm not alone with my thoughts. Just to have noise and a distraction. I'd never tell anyone that, and when they're busy I just say ""I understand"". It's hard though and you want to tell them how you need them, but you can't risk them not understanding. 

I'm not really a good person or a friend though. I haven't been for a long time. I try to be but I usually end up letting everyone down or being a burden. Pushing people away or just drifting apart. I put on a mask and try and do what I think people want to see. With everything that's happened in my life over the past couple years and months it's like that mask doesn't really fit anymore. 

I'm not really sure how I can keep going. I'm tired.",depression
211,t3_dkv2lx,I can't tell if people talk to me out of pity or if they actually want to talk to me.,"I'm a 16 year old male. Whenever someone I barely ever talks to tries to initiate conversation or just makes small talk when they see me in the hallway at school or something I can't tell if they are actually wanting to talk to me or they do it out of pity, or even making fun of me.

You know how some people jokingly talk to people that others deem as *weird*. It almost seems sarcastic in the way they talk to me.

Now it might just be me being paranoid but my it changed my behavior a lot. Now I don't talk as much and whenever someone talks to me or gives me a compliment I feel like I talk in a cold tone so they don't actually think I am falling for their joke. And later when I question these interactions I wonder if they weren't mocking me or making fun of me and had genuine intentions and I just came across as an asshole.

Besides this apparently I'm a very quiet person which I never realized until people asked me why I'm so quiet or my friends say that I'm quiet when we are with other people.

This has been driving my mind up the wall and questioning if I have been living a lie and are people making fun of me behind my back. I never suspected myself to be a so called *weird* person. Now I don't care about popularity and whatnot and I guess some people find me peculiar in ways that are not bad. It almost makes me feel that I am going crazy and have lost all self awareness as what I am doing.",depression
212,t3_dkv2gs,Trouble eating with depression,"Hey I like eating a lot but with depression/feeling bad I've had trouble finding any reason to eat aside from staying alive and cause it tastes good.

How do I stop feeling this way?",depression
213,t3_dksgi6,New poster here. Has anything helped your depression?,"There’s so much I could type out but I’ve been living with depression for about 2 years. To most people I guess it would be considered “high functioning” because I work full time. But realistically, the only thing I do besides be at work is be in bed or at the gym a couple times a week. Weekends are spent in my bed almost entirely. To me, it’s very debilitating. My fatigue is so limiting. 

I have been on 3 medications on/off, did not find that they helped a lot. My last one was lexapro which I had quit after a week or two because I was absolutely petrified of the weight gain I hear as a side affect. I recently lost about 30lbs and became more active, which has also not helped.

I am considering therapy, however the thought of it has given me very extreme anxiety and I am unsure of how to approach that. Has anyone done therapy, and it helped? Or anything else that helped them?

I unfortunately feel like my depression is stealing years off of my life, and has made it extremely hard on my relationship as I know sometimes he gets extremely fed up.

I cried massively when he told me he wanted to kill himself. I felt really hopeless. 

His patience with me is thin and he’s easily frustrated with me. This bums me a lot since I mess up pretty easily. I get irritated but I try to understand that he has a mental health issue. 

Often, when he lashes out, I just try to stay quiet and cry while I let him vent/rant but he said he hates when I’m doing nothing. 

I asked him, “What can I do to make you happy?” He said: “Just show you care.” I asked him how because I wanted to get a specific answer so that I can ease his pain but he just called me out by saying “We’re in a relationship for almost 3 years and you still don’t know how to make me happy?”

He keeps complaining that I don’t understand what he’s going through, I contribute nothing in his life and that he doesn’t need me. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. I need help as to how can I make a depressed person’s life a bit better? What kind of steps should I do to make him have a more positive outlook in life?

222,t3_dkuyhu,I’m at a loss. This situation is toxic and there’s no escape...,"I’m in college, battling servers depression and anxiety, also fighting a small but persistent and painful stomach condition. I’ve been seeing my therapist for about 6 weeks now. He’s incredible. But, a lot of issues comes from my roommate. He keeps me up far to late, every night, then wakes me up every morning. I’m constantly exhausted. He goes though my stuff, touches it all, and I have very little personal space because he takes up most of it. I’m a nice guy, so I let it slide. But he is also very messy. I tell him to clean, he says ok and doesn’t. He’s a compulsive liar. He frequently runs away (physically and figuratively) from his issues. 

Here comes the juicy part:

Once, he got drunk and told me that he doesn’t care about my grades, he claimed I don’t work hard in school, and then (here’s the kicker!!) he told me my girlfriend was a dick. Who in their right mind says that shit? Yes, he was drunk. He apologized.... for being drunk. Not for what he said. I’m in the transfer process, so I won’t be seeing much of him after I’m out in December. My therapist listens to me talk about him, and how a lot of my stress and anxiety stem from how roommate treats me. And he gave me this piece of paper, that gives me coping mechanisms on how to deal with “spiraling” from my thoughts. It helped me pin point what was wrong in my head and actually really helped me out a lot. 

So I went home this weekend. I left the paper in my top drawer (I’ve had it for 6 days at this point, so I have not memorized the 10 bullet points and what they mean). I go back today to look for it, and it’s gone. Along with it being gone, he stole batteries from my top drawer (he did that under a week ago and I told him to never do that again and took the batteries), and even his debit card and ID were literally in my drawer... I confronted him, he said he had no idea where it was. Now, logically, why would anyone take it? Why would he? But someone clearly took it because it’s not there. I don’t believe a single thing he says, so I’m almost certain he did something with it. 

6 days ago, funny enough, I contacted my RA to get an emergency medical single, because I simply can’t handle the anxiety he gives me on a day to day basis. He contacted his boss, and said she’d email me. I haven’t received an email for help. So I have no choice but to live here. I live too far to commute. What am I supposed to do? He’s mentally destroying me, and I’ve been making progress recently and I feel he’s taking it away from me and it’s such a powerless and sad feeling, when I felt I was getting mentally better.",depression

I convinced myself that she’s worth one more try, I spent all month planing it and for once I felt good about something.

240,t3_dkuoy1,I need to talk to someone about this," I feel like I need to talk about this but I don't know anyone who would hear me.

 I'm a dude from a third world country who's always been ""succesful"" to my peers. I work, I study for a major and I live alone, so my friends tend to tell me they envy me and such, but in reality I've felt gray for a long while now and it's starting to get scary.

 I've been feeling like this for a long while, but I used to think about it like ""Maybe if I try/get X thing I'll feel better"".

  When it started, I thought it had to do with sex. So I put effort into losing my virginity, lost it shortly after and it was a terrible experience.

Then I thought ""Well maybe if I try having sex with someone I actually like and not a one night stand I'll feel better"". Put effort into getting a girlfriend, got one shortly after, was not the thing I needed tbh, I liked the idea of loving someone but I couldn't bring myself to do so, so after 6 months I broke up with her.

Then I thought ""Well it maybe has to do with independence, if I find a place to live by myself I'll be able to live how I want"" I don't even have to explain how wrong I was, what a clown. The only thing this did is add a constant fear of somebody entering my house to my worries.

 It's kinda hard to explain through words but I feel like I'm ignoring myself, like if something affects me I ignore it's effects. As I got more and more responsibilities this feeling intensified, and I'm scared now. I'm scared because I feel like I can't go back. I don't choose to ignore these things, it already happens automatically.

I used to feel relief in the idea of not having anything. Like, if I didn't have the job I have, I could just focus on my degree while being broke. But when I think about that, I remember that at some point, I was like that and I did my best to escape that stage. I'm also terrified by the idea of losing my job, so I always feel tense in my workplace. If I lose it, then all of this time I spent working instead of socializing, instead of going to the gym, instead of playing my favourite instrument would have been for nothing. 

 The worst thing about all of this is that I've had many friends telling me that they feel like shit when comparing their lives to mine, that they envy my achievements. I don't feel like I've earned any of this, if there was someone else living my life right now, most of them would feel way better than I do about it,  and my friends seem to confirm it. 

 I know that if I keep working like I do this feeling will get worse, but I also know that if I quit any of the things I'm doing I'll feel like shit. I'm scared of quitting because I have people who look up to me and I don't want to disappoint them.

 I hate that I chose this life, I am grossed out by the fact that I can't let go of anything that ""defines"" me, like being a teacher, because if I do I won't be shit, but I don't want to be a teacher anyway. I don't like being looked up to either, I can't do what I want because the only close people I have look up to me.

Everyone thinks I'm successful and independent and happy, but I'm on the verge of stepping in front of a train. What I want is to go home--real home, my parents' home--and be with my old cat and get professional help.

I've avoided therapy and medication for years, while those who do know of my struggles have begged me all along to get help. I actually want help now. But I can't imagine surviving much longer here, where I know no one, where no one loves me…I can't imagine how therapy will fit into my schedule, let alone the anxiety of the associated financial costs of therapy and medication.

Last night, after two beers, I went out and bought a bottle of whiskey. I almost finished it. I threw up twice, ruining the new rug I got for my bedroom. Cleaning it was hopeless this morning, so I tossed it. I'm so ashamed. This summer after completing grad school, I took myself on a 2-month trip to New Zealand. Based on social media, it was a happy, exciting adventure. But what I did mostly was drink alone in hostels.

I want to die, but it also scares me how close I feel to actually killing myself. I've researched easy-access roofs in NYC, I've researched the probability of a quick and relatively painless death by subway car…I've made a list of things I need to do to get my affairs in order so things will at least be logistically easy for my parents. One less thing for them to worry about.

I spent the day with them today. We saw Joker, which was triggering because of all the severe mental health stuff in it. When they dropped me off at the train, I almost told them. They only think I wanted to kill myself once, when I was 17. I told them then, because my friends forced my hand and would have told them if I didn't. I'll be 26 in December. They think I'm thriving. I don't want them to know how bad I am.

Also, there's the shame of leaving a job I've only been at for a month--a job I enjoy, and I'm reasonably good at, and where I'm definitely needed. My rabbi personally recommended me (the job is at a synagogue). I can't imagine letting him and the whole team down. I'd rather die than quit and have to face the fallout.

Its all I know

Can't you see?

I am not your muse

I am your plague

I will break you down

Take all that was pure

And leave a big black stain

Right over your heart

Your pretty little heart

I don't deserve you

And you surely don't deserve me

I am a moth drawn to the flame

And that flame will be my down fall

I will fly closer and closer

Day in and day out

No matter the burns

The scares and melting flesh

I will fly ever closer

Until one day

When the flame consumes my tortured wings

Turning my suffering into ashes

And fueling the flame so you don't have to

Drawing the next victim closer

Into the warm comfort of self destruction

245,t3_dkhgj9,I'm so fucking lonely,"Every time I post on Reddit, I get some people message me, pretending to care. I posted to r/amiugly and got a few responses, one guy tricked me into looking at his nudes, and due to my hypersexuality and lonlieness I caved. I returned the favor, felt disgusting after. 
No one just wants to be a friend, they all want something in return. I'm fat and ugly, I'm trying so hard to lose weight. But I stress eat. I walk every day and distract myself with projects but when I'm alone I stress eat. People say my body is fine, but I see it. I see how people look at me. People treat me differently because I'm not girlfriend material. I'm just an aquaintance. 
I want someone I can hang out with, someone I can talk to that won't betray me. Over the internet is useless, I want a physical connection. I want someone to hug me I'm so touched starved nothing sexual I'm just so fucking lonely.
I've never had anyone to talk to and laugh with. I've never had a real friend. I wish people would message me and it never lead to sexual shit. It always goes there. I just want someone to play games with, go walking with. I don't know how much longer I can last like this. I have no one. My life fucking sucks.",depression

My parents expect the best from me, but to be honest I’m probably going to disappoint them in the end. I even disappointed that girl because she didn’t feel a connection with me.

Lately, it has been getting harder and harder for me to get myself to do anything. I have been falling deeper and deeper into my depression over the last year. On some days, I get these intense episodes of sadness where I just cry and cry to the point where I can literally feel my heartaching. I already had very low energy, but I recently reached the point where I don't have the energy to get up from bed anymore.

I see myself distancing myself from my loved ones, even my significant partner. I see the pain and sadness in my partner's eyes. He feels absolutely helpless as he sees me sink deeper and deeper into my depression. He's at the end of his wits. I'm really close to losing him too. 

I don't want to lose him, but I especially don't want to lose myself. I don't want to feel the emptiness anymore. I don't want to feel like I would be better off not existing anymore. I don't want to feel like my existence is a burden. I don't want to feel like this anymore. 

I have tried so many different strategies along with regularly eating healthy, working out, making plans with loved ones, and etc... However, I don't think it's enough anymore. As much as it frightens me, I'm making plans to seeking professional help to undergo more intensive treatment. I can't do this on my own anymore.

I spend my whole life caring for others. Doing my damn best to put a smile on peoples faces. Whether it’s ensuring their birthday goes well or just trying to remember their name after one interaction. 

It’s all a front. It’s what I do to cope with the fact that I’m internally miserable. If I try to reach out to other I end up helping them out and burying my thoughts deeper within me. 

This morning I actually pondered ending it. I’ve never said that out loud to anyone except one time in therapy over a year ago. Maybe it’s healthy to say it so it doesn’t become real. I never could though. I couldn’t do that to my mom, dad, and brother. They mean to much to me.

267,t3_dkocgc,Anyone else alternate between they have a handle on it and then realizing that you've barely begun?,"I've been doing a ton of introspection lately to try and get at the root of my feelings of lack of self-worth and depression. Some days I feel like I'm finally really understanding myself and I'm able to be compassionate to myself. On days like that I tell myself that the mental health challenges that I have aren't insurmountable and are a reasonable response to how I was raised and to past trauma.   


Other days, especially when I'm in a funk, I start to read online and begin to think that, in addition to depression and anxiety, I have co-dependency issues, covert narcissism, BPD and so forth. I do see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with a mild-to-moderate social anxiety disorder. But when I get into these funky days I convince myself that I held back part of myself from my shrink and wasn't totally open and I'm much more messed up than I let on.   


I feel like I function reasonably well at work and a lot of it comes from a fake-it-to-make-it mindset I carry into work. Sometimes I feel like that's really helping to cope with things and by forcing myself to be in control of myself at work, it's helping me in my personal life. Other times, it feels like a false front since I still have all of these insecurities and worries inside, still.

I feel as if I'm finally to the point of letting it take over, for I've fought it off for far too long. 15 years of my life spent keeping my head up despite the wars raging in my head. 15 years of my life spent waiting for a happiness I once thought I deserved.

8 of those years were spent with someone who I thought loved me unconditionally. Yet 5 of those 8 years were spent begging them to admit they weren't in love with me. That I was nothing more than a crutch. Then a month before our anniversary, it finally happened. They then had the freedom to be with the person they'd been talking to behind my back for months.  It happened so breath takingly slowly that it didnt hurt as much as one would think. Though I cant help but to feel like I'd wasted so much precious time. 

I moved on fairly quickly, to a guy who had pinned for me since we were teenagers. I'd been so emotionally neglected that I didnt see it as a warning sign when he was practically obsessed with me from the start. Talk of having babies within the first week, moved in with me after a month, and proposal after two. It all became old quickly. What I thought may have been love turned into constant sexual abuse. I wasnt allowed to get on birth control and somehow in the year that I was with him, I didnt end up pregnant. I feel like if I wouldn't have gotten out of that when I did, I would have ended up on the evening news.

Next many months were spent drinking and having causal hookups. I said I'd never trust again. But the hooking up was getting old, it felt too off without a sort of emotional connection. Then someone caught my eye. I dont know what convinced me to go out to the movies with him, but I did. We walked around the park for hours just talking after that. I was upfront and said that I wasn't looking for anything at the moment, he respected that and said that he could always use another friend. A friend. That sounded nice. But somewhere between the amazing sex (cant help it, I finally felt something with him) and staying up all night talking...it blossomed into something much more. I'd been in two serious relationships now and I never felt anything close to what I felt for him. What was even better is that we were on the same page....

Or so I thought. Six months later and he has up and left me without warning. He went from saying he could see us building a future together to being ice cold within a few weeks.

I think that was finally my breaking point. I can barely get out of bed these days. I've cut off all my friends. I'm getting behind on bills because I can't work as much. I've started writing hypothetical goodbyes.

I'm just...done.

I'm constantly in this mood where I feel emptiness all the time and I drink alcohol maybe 5 times a week which makes me overall more anxious and depressed but in the moment, it makes me feel not anxious and confident. This weekend I considered ending my life- trying to overdose on my antidepressants, and looked for other ways to do it. 

It drives me crazy because I am blessed to have such an amazing family, friends, fortunate family background, but I just feel sad all the time with no real cause - because I am anxious and sad, I seem to self-sabotage with everything good around me, whether it being with boys, etc. 

I just feel like a girl who is just floating, doesn't know herself so I just keep drinking to feel something. I am prescribed to take 35 mg of this antidepressant and I felt extra anxious and so I took 2 on Friday. I began drinking early that noon and continued into the next day and night. I called a suicide hotline yesterday, looked for ways to kill myself, but I just can't do it. My thoughts are killing me and I just want everything to be over. I barely even remember the past few days and it scares me to know I'm probably slowly killing myself with alcohol. 

I go to a therapist, and it helps at the moment but she even tells me herself that she is worried about me and that she doesn't know who she's talking to whenever I come in for a session. I just feel so lost and I go to all my classes but can't focus, then when a midterm comes up, I can't study no matter how many hours I sit at the library because my depression is clouding my thoughts. 

I have a 3.1 GPA and am probably getting C's and B's in my classes right now and I think I will become more depressed if my GPA hits the 2's. I want to take a break from school but idk what I would do during that time and I am already a 5th year but feel that this state and school is making me feel this way. I'm just so tired of everything and my family doesn't even know anything about this- the only reason why I'm still here is because of them and because i hate pain and don't wanna hurt myself. 

I don't really know what to do anymore but i'm scared to see what I end up doing to end my life. I feel like everyone goes about their day and I just always feel this cloud over my head and nobody can fix me. I also have a midterm AND quiz this Wednesday, and also a formal presentation on Tuesday and I cannot find the heart to do anything. How can I ask for an extension?

One day I will just want to make the pain stop.

I have a reoccurring dream. I’m in the car and on my way to a trip I can never return, and I realize I haven’t said goodbye to my daughter, how she’s going to be very hurt I didn’t remember to say it. I wake up sick to my stomach and my chest hurting from the stress. I’m fairly certain this is my mind rationalizing wanting to die. Yet, still…I want to die. 

My husband sobbed to me this week when he learned that I had been suicidal on and off our entire 15-year marriage. He couldn’t understand why I hadn’t ever told him. I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want him to stop me. I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want his tears. I didn’t tell him because no matter how long I have and the words I use, he will never understand my pain. 

It’s been a few weeks since I’ve gotten out of bed to do anything other than go to work. I haven’t cooked in a year. I haven’t talked to my friends in about the same. Depression though isn’t worth telling people about. You get the same tired line about having so much to be happy about. I do but I’m not.

This girl is incredibly sarcastic and makes suicide jokes all the time. She has the edgiest humor and we use it to talk about difficult things.
However I've just heard her crying in a voicemail(ive never seen her cry in person) telling me her and her bf just broke up, she 'can't take it anymore' and 'she'll kill herself in a bit' and also she 'cant make it on thursday'.
Now since I had missed that voicemail there was already a more recent one in a normal tone saying 'oh hey yeah i think i might be able to make it on thursday, ill see about it tho'. Also a text about the first vm asking me to 'not tell anyone'.
I have no idea how to handle this correctly. I don't know if she was 100% serious and i want to be there for her but whenever I get in a bad place i cut off all social contact for a few days, which is why i didnt hear the vm at first.

281,t3_dkr63n,I lost all ability to keep routine for 2 years but this is how i combated it.,Hi two years ago i came down with depression quite badly. Everything went out of the window getting up in the morning became a massive struggle. even down to the small things like brushing my teeth became a struggle. Ive tryed for months now to get back the routine that i lost all those years ago. Unfortunately i just couldnt do it. But a month ago i came up with a idea. A simple one. every time i need to brush my teeth. if i get up and do so i put a pound in a jar. The money goes towards getting something i really want. To my surprise its worked and ive got back my routine. I thought i would share this with you as mabe it could help someone. Even if its just one person that it helps and helps them tackle getting their routine back. Im happy. You could apply this trick to anything. Like if you struggle to get up and get dressed in the morning. you could put a pound in the jar each time you do it. And it really feels like your rewarding yourself for doing so.

 I thought making friends would make things better. We hang out, have fun. But noone calls to chat me or prefers my company over another friend.

294,t3_dktn62,Living with yourself,"So I recently started watching this show on Netflix called ""Living With Yourself"" starring Paul Rudd.

Basically they're into this technology called ultra-rapid cloning and synaptic memory transfer where they create a clone of him which is the best possible version of him. 

This got me thinking— what would the best possible version of me be like? I wonder if I'd be good-looking? Sexy? Likable? Not depressed? Not a complete waste of space? Not gay? I have wished so many times that instead of the sperm that fertilized into me, if it were some other sperm, or egg, and that version of me were to actually be the best possible combination of my parents. Life would have been so much better if I was better. But I'm stuck with this crappy life and crappy body. I am stuck inside me, inside this faulty, sad, depressed, shitty body. I wonder if maybe things were different and I weren't gay. Then I'd probably have had a normal childhood. Perhaps I might have even been happy. I might have ended up being in a relationship with someone. I probably would not be this sad ugly fat virgin who is 21 years old and has never known what a kiss feels like.

""Solitude""

The voice in my head

Is the only familiar voice I hear in a week or two,

The dark ensues,

A loneliness tells me that life’s for two,

But where and who?

How do I find someone for talking to,

A person who,

Will listen and care like I want them to,

To confide into,

To tell me it’s fine when I need them to,

Solitude,

That familiar place, In that hotel room Inside my mind,

That same old view,

Pull up one chair to a game for two,

Lying alone in a bed made to rest two peoples heads on

My Dreams are few,

The familiar hand of loneliness Grips my heart tight and I cant pry it loose,

I tell myself, again and again,

That I won’t feel this pain in a year or two,

But out of the blue,

Quick as a flash 5 years can elapse now at the rate of few,

A moment in time,

Years goes by,

So much quicker than I ever want them to,

I was 22,

5 years on feels like 5 minutes passed in the space of two,

5 years ago I thought 5 years from then,

I’d be happy by now But I’m more consumed,

I’m just confused,

At how I allow myself to sit back while my life falls through,

I try to ignore but the pain comes through,

My whole body aches,

I just need a break for a minute or two,

I’m screaming inside,

I cry all the time,

alone and afraid that I won’t make it through,

Solitude.",depression
298,t3_dktk74,Feelings that I can't explain,"I'll try my best.

Every day gets harder and harder to go on. Anything good that comes into my life leaves just as quickly. I spend most of my time alone and not by choice. I feel worthless. People make me feel worthless. There may not be any ill-intentions behind other actions, but it hurts to feel left out, to feel unlovable, to feel as if I'm less of a human.

People want open and honest, so I'll be open and honest, but that scares people away. And I never overshare. When I'm not open and honest, I can't ever form any connections (however baseless and empty they may be).

It feels as if I don't belong in this world. It feels like I can't be accepted for who I am and I always have to be providing something of value to be valued. But as things are now, I really don't have any value, and I know this. It hurts to know I don't have anything of value to offer people.

I just wish I had one person who made me feel wanted in this world. Someone where it doesn't matter if I'm ""on"" every day. Where it doesn't matter if I can't always provide something. Someone who cares about my thoughts and opinions. Someone who can make me feel human.

I live far away from my immediate family members, which means I don't get to see them that often. I love my family and cherish the limited time that I get to spend with them, yet I often find myself inexplicably depressed whenever any of them pays me a visit. Oftentimes, I find it stressful to try and find activities I could do with them to keep them entertained during their stay. I also would get annoyed sometimes when I don't get time for myself or time to do productive things/follow my regular schedule like when I have no company.

I think part of it comes from the fact that as an introvert, I need alone time to recharge. Therefore, when there's always someone else constantly being in my space, I'd get exhausted. However, I think I can control the situation better, since my family members know enough to respect my space when I need it. I just can't seem to remember to let them know that or know how to even inform them of that. Instead, I'd let my negative emotions get the better of me and make me  depressed/grumpy during the limited amount of time that I get to spend with my beloved family members. I'd try to hide my depressive mood, which would sometimes backfire and make me snap at my family. After they leave, I'd almost always feel guilty and sad that I haven't made their stay as good as it could have got.

Another part of it might come from my unhealthy attitude toward my parents. Occasionally, during depressive episodes, I'd find myself blaming my parents for having given birth to me. At this point in life, I hate my existence more than I love it, even though I care enough about my loved ones to have no plans of killing myself. I don't feel hatred toward my parents when they visit, but maybe I subconsciously get negative feelings when I see them as a result of my attitude toward how they gave birth to me?

Sorry this has been an incoherent ramble. I guess this is sort of a rant to get me off my chest and to see if anyone else suffers from the same issue.

316,t3_dkt6cv,First time here. Needing to vent and let it out.,"Let me say first by saying hello to those who are kind enough to read what I am about to write.  


I don't know how to start but here it goes. When I was 7, I was devastated by losing the most important person in my life at the time, my grandfather. My first memory of anything depression related was shortly after that. I remember feeling so down that I decided to steal a knife from the kitchen, ran to a hiding spot in the house, and decided I did not want to keep living, I wanted to be with my grandfather. So for about 30 or so minutes, I pushed the tip to my chest and contemplated doing what no 7 year old should ever even think of.  Yet something told me it wasn't the right time, and I returned the knife back to the kitchen. This is where this section of depression seems to disappear from my memory. 

Fast forward throughout the years of grade school. I had random thoughts, especially after being in trouble, being yelled at, that I would wrap myself in a blanket and say I will just end from extreme heat ( silly thing about it now). But yet the thoughts were still there. At that age I really did not have much of understanding of what I was going through. 

We get to high school stage of my life. I go through changes, like the rest of us, figuring out who we are, and the person we will become. I went through a dark time, attempting to end my life 3 times. First was by hanging myself with a belt. The belt ended up ripping and for a short while I believed it was not meant to be. 2nd was attempting to drown myself, this was by far the most painful way to attempt, and of course failed. Time goes on a bit and I was set off again by life events, and decided to swallow roughly 40-60 or more pills of Tylenol. I reached for help, and the one person that reached out I lied to, and I spent the next week throwing up, but yet never went to the hospital. 

This like the other 2 times failed. I saw this as it was not my time to go. I became obsessed with death, the grim reaper, angel of death, whatever you wish to call him. Around this time I was 19-20 and I lost my life long animal friend, I watched him die and promised in his honor I would get a tattoo of the grim reaper to always remind me that Death could not touch me since he was always with me.

The way I always dealt with my depression was drinking, even before I was 21. I would kill a 6-12 pack if I was feeling down and cry, be alone, or whatever else and the next day I would be fine. This continued until about a year and a half ago. This is when I realized that my issue was progressing far beyond what I could do on my own. I have met the love of my life, and married in this time. The depression subsided for awhile, but was always somewhere down deep where I hid it. That was until one day.

It manifested, and more then ever. I suddenly felt one night when my wife was away that I felt like the only way I could feel better was to end it. So I drank my beer/liqour, whatever it was, grabbed my pistol, and started a fire outside. And this next part is hard to say. I sat outside, pistol loaded, 1 in the chamber, and cried my eyes out as I contemplated ending it all. How easy it would be to just squeeze the trigger and be done. But yet something made me put it down, unload, and just sleep it off.

Shortly after I  talked to my wife. It was the hardest thing I ever have done, and explained I need help. Unfortunate life had planned another hardship. My Grandma (my grandfather's wife from the beginning of my story) had gotten sick. And ultimately passed away. Being the only connection left to my Grandfather, this hit me harder then I ever expected. And I sought out the help medically/therapy wise. This worked for a good year and half.

Now we get to present day. I am medication, which helps curb my depression and anxiety. But I still find myself hitting these low points constantly, I end up drinking, passing out, waking up going to work and repeating. I feel like I have no future, no ambition to go forward. But yet I don't want to end it. But I can't look forward to the next day. 

Writing this had not been easy, and even if it is on the internet with strangers, I feel like I need to just let it out and tell someone, anyone who will hear. I just recently lost a friend to suicide, and it hit me harder then anything else in life. I cried for 3 days randomly.

But regarding depression, regarding how I feel inside, regarding my life and my future, no matter how shitty I feel, I have this small thread of hope deep deep deep in my head, that I hold on to subconsciously. I hold on desperately to this idea that it's going to get better, that all the moments I fantasize when I daydream is going to be my future. That one day, my life will be changed and I'll be in a place where I've never been before.

Maybe it's because I'm still young (18) and I feel like I have a future. Maybe it's my personality. Maybe it's cause I can be an emotional and sensitive person. Maybe it's because I still believe in trust and true love, and that maybe because I'm again too young. Maybe it's because my depression isn't as bad as some of you guys. Maybe it's because I don't feel suicidal anymore. But as hopeless as everything feels and as much pessimistic attitude how hold in daily life, I feel like deep deep deep inside my head, I have this hope and optimism that yearns for a bright side. It's like even if I constantly give up in my daily life, I just can't give up this hope that's embedded deep inside my head.

Can anyone relate? I just want to know if there is people like me. I know depression is something many experience, where many feel hopeless, and I feel that way too sometimes, but there is always this strange hope that I hang onto subconsciously. I look up hope in this subreddit, and it's only about losing hope, but nothing about this hidden feeling I hold on to. I guess it helps me keep going on, at least the feeling is somewhat useful.",depression
318,t3_dkt65t,Im in a rough place and it won't stop.,"I'm not a regular here on reddit, so I apologize if I fall out of any guidelines here. I also apologize for grammar/spelling/cursing.

I'm a 26 year old guy living with my parents after a bad breakup and work 2 jobs so I can eventually afford my own place. I'm a disabled-retired vet, although I never experienced a significantly dangerous military career. I have depression and anxiety pretty severely, but all of the therapists and meds never work very long.

I wake up everyday, and my first thought is, ""God d*mmit, I'm still here."" I hate myself, I could have everything I want and I'd still be miserable. I spend most of my day wanting to eat a cyanide pill. I've called suicide hotlines, my parents, old friends, old nco's, and it all leads back to me wanting a huge lead breakfast.

If life is a natural occurence, sentient life is meaningless without purpose, i'm in charge of giving my life meaning and can't even pretend I'm happy, whats the point? The world will keep being itself without me. Maybe even have one less invalid hanging about.

Seriously, the only thing keeping me here is that whoever has to deal with the aftermath of my poor existence has to clean it all up. I wish I could hug someone and cry or wish someone would have the decency to shoot me in between the eyes. I just can't take it much more.

323,t3_dkm16c,Sometimes I wish I wasn't me,"I wrote this to express my thoughts, so they wouldn't be stuck in my head. 

Would it not be easy to be a different person for a day? Like in the book / movie ""Every Day"" having the opportunity to change that person's life. To be stuck in someone else's head instead of your own. Simply to not have to worry about being a burden to those you love, to not feel difficult. Why is it when you feel your life is finally getting better, it only gets worse inside? One thing can remind you of every bad experience you ever had, and you get taken back to those very moments, as if they happened today. We are told every day to not waste a moment in our life, as we don't know when it ends. Spend as much time with your loved ones as possible, because you never know if there is a tomorrow. Hope is difficult to have when life can feel like a punishment; making mistake after mistake, uncertain if we will learn from them this time. Those who attempt to inspire us every day: people like Jay Shetty, or Jordan Peterson who tells us the rules of life. It is easier to inspire than to feel like an inspiration.

This entire text would change from a different perspective. Someone who knows there are positive things in life, and not just negative. The truth is, not everything in life can be positive, but not everything is negative either. If we spend too much time nitpicking at our lives, we would be like crows stealing interesting objects; it would never, ever end. 

Depression sucks. It pulls you down when you expect it the least. All hope fades. Some get out themselves, some get out with help, and some never get out. This is just reality.

Substance abuse disorder and bipolar.

It took a very long time from the moment I decided I no longer wanted to be a drug addict to actually feeling mentally stable. About two years.

I relapsed a lot, stopped going to my appointments, went off my medications and so forth.

I no longer do any drugs or drink alcohol so I do not have interactions with my medications which being antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.

I take gabapentin, lamictal and Latuda.

It’s a good combination for me. The Latuda helps with racing thoughts and anxiety and seems to help me eat less (counterbalances the gabapentin.)

The gabapentin is mainly for social anxiety

Lamictal keeps my moods stable so I don’t become manic or majorly depressed.

I go to a therapist weekly and she seems to understand where I’m coming from and we have a lot of the same ideas for harm reduction and how to assess situations so kind of reinforces behaviors and thoughts for me.

Also might I add, inpatient facilities can greatly increase your chances of turning your life around depending on which ones you go to. A lot of people are against these but many of them have been instituted at bad facilities with bad nurses or counselors and doctors who have no idea what they’re doing in terms of prescribing medications.

Yes the 10-14 day sucks but what is two weeks to the rest of your life? 

The reason why I even mentioned inpatient isn’t because my experience with them but someone very close to me who had incredibly noticeable differences from going to one. (he’s been to two and the first one sucked and they did not help him which caused him to eventually be in a crisis needing to go to another.)

347,t3_dkpo0g,For anyone struggling right now,"Hi everyone,

Just wanted to talk to people who are going through the wkorst about how I got over the most severe time of my depression, it's nothing too dramatic but if it's any inspiration or help to someone on this subreddit I feel like it's worth posting.

So I've always been depressive, I have my ups and downs but when I was 20/21 I went through an extremely severe period where I didn't get out of bed for days at a time and barely left the house, I smoked a lot of weed every day to numb myself and was never sober. I was in university and living with a few roommates who didn't understand what I was going through, and I felt like I had no friends and had ruined my life, and everyone would better off if I didn't exist. 

Eventually I called my parents to bring me home because I was suicidal and desperate, and they did it on the condition that I stop all smoking and drinking and go to a doctor asap. My local doctor recommended that I go on antidepressants and exercise daily. I was willing to do anything at that time and I went on 50mg sertraline a day and did some jogging up and down a pitch near my house. After a few weks I was able to get up early every day, get out of bed and do some exercise. The NHS councillor only saw me once to establish that I was no longer suicidal, but after about 6 months of setraline and exercise my mental health was much improved and I gradually stopped taking the pills.

I dropped out of an aerospace engineering degree to move back home and focus on my mental health, and today I work in a local manufacturing company stacking shelves for a low wage, but I'm in a better place than ever. I met the love of my life after moving back to my hometown, and I'm currently getting some engineering qualifications through local colleges and enjoying the journey. I'm 24 now and I still have times when I feel down, but that period of my life taught me a lot about depression and for anyone going through the worst of it I have a few tips:

-Talk to someone! The worst thing about depression is the feeling of hopelessness and that no one cares about you, the world is a better place with you in it and there's no shame in talking to family and friends if you're in a bad place

-Antidepressants aren't magic but will help you on your journey, when I took sertraline it gave me more energy and motivation but excercise and routine are what really helps, the antidepressants will give you the energy to help you establish those routines but they won't ""fix"" you by themselves

-Go to sleep and get out of bed at the same times every day, establishing a routine is great for your mental health

-Keep your room/living environment clean and tidy, this is the space you spend the most time in so it's important to keep it in good condition

-Clean your teeth, brush your hair, dress well and put aftershave/perfume on, even if you're not going to leave your room or your house. Maintaining your appearance and hygiene is an important affirmation that you are worth taking care of, which you are!

-Most importantly, talk to a medical professional if you need help. No one on the internet can fully understand the context of your depression and face-to-face contact with a professional is the most important step to put you on the journey to recovery and happiness

I'm not a mental health expert in any way but I struggled very hard and managed to come back from rock bottom, if I can do it then anyone can. Much love from Ireland guys and best wishes on your journey, it's never too late.",depression

349,t3_dksjp4,I feel like I’ve hit the end of the road yet I’ve barely even started,"I recently turned 20 and I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and it feels like I’m almost completely worn out. 
I was in a car accident back in January of this year and despite nobody being seriously injured the events still keep me up at night and cause a great deal of anxiety when it comes to getting into a car. 
I’m also dealing with a recent diagnosis of autism, despite knowing for a while that it was something I had somehow being officially diagnosed with it makes it more real. 
I’ve been a college student for nearly 4 years now and I’m currently studying the second year of a level 3 BTEC in Computing, the content that’s been delivered to us so far has made very little sense to me (more so since one of my peers left for university) and in fact caused me to have a anxiety attack in class as the realisation of not knowing anything and having to take an exam in January took hold. It also doesn’t help that the staff want me to get a 9 week work experience placement and also refuse to let me leave the course. 
A lot of the time I think to myself how I’m now 20 years old and yet I’ve accomplished nothing significant and am pathetically struggling with simple things that everyone else seems to have no issues with. My parents are in their early 60s and I’m an only child so I always have a daunting fear of loosing them and disappointing them by not being able to drive, have a family of my own or have the mental capacity to deal with the work place. 
I’ve always wanted to become a YouTuber since I envy a lot of big creators but I lack the skills/imagination/creativity to make videos and have no motivation or ability to teach myself. 

This post is a complete mess since I’ve no idea how to structure it and I’m really just writing down problems that I’m dealing with as they arise to me at 1am with the inability to sleep and the fear of having to go to college in less than 10 hours",depression
350,t3_dksjbi,"I guess this is the closest to contentment I'll ever get, so please cancel my subscription to life","Right about now would be an alright time to die. I've accomplished everything I possibly can in this life (which is absolutely nothing). I've experienced all the happiness I could hope for (the bare minimum. Nothing these last 7-8 years, occasionally in the ten-year period before that, and I'm sure I was at least somewhat happy when I was a kid). I've been in love and been loved a couple of times (three to be precise). I've experienced friendship (I've had one friend). I have a good education (that's a lie), a job I love (another lie, I have a semi-ok job), and a wonderful family (yet another lie). I have a nice apartment (I had to move back in with my mom after I got addicted to heroin, spent all my money on drugs and got kicked out of my tiny flat), and a bright future ahead of me (lol!). 

In other words, things can only go down-hill from here. At least I've been clean for almost four years now. I say that like it's a good thing. I tried to kill myself five years ago, failed and was put in a psych ward for a total of three months. At least I received the help I needed there (jk). 

My life isn't going to improve, if anything it will just get worse, so I might as well die now. I've made peace with the fact that I didn't amount to anything, that I've wasted my life and any potential I might've had. That I'm a total failure as a human being and a waste of space. That even though I thought life was shitty when I was 18, that was my peak, that's the best it's gonna get. I'm not gonna kill myself just yet, but I would appreciate if I could just die now. I'm ready, come on. God or Allah or fate or whatever's in charge, strike me down, it's ok. Please don't let me suffer anymore. Don't make me experience what more horrible stuff life most certainly is gonna throw in my face.

363,t3_dks3xn,"I am depressed and my husband does not understand, says I'm lazy and fat, I hate myself for being this way.","Hi guys, little background: I met my husband 5 years ago when I was skinny, blonde, tan, lashes and  nails done, pretty girl with no worries (well no nothing really cause i didn't own much). I had no car, very minimalist bedroom of only a few items. Now i think is what helped me stay happy is I didn't have much stuff to take care of. My husband grew up poor so he is a hoarder and had a lot of stuff but I can't keep up with having it organized. 

Years passed and since I am European he would always take me to try all these different foods and restaurants to try and  I gained quite a bit of weight. I'm almost 200 lb now being 5 ft 4 in. 😣

I cry a lot (almost every night) because I love him very much and I would give everything for him, he says he loves me, tries to comfort me and then next morning says: ""I went from having a happy healthy girlfriend to having a fat lazy wife."" I think that he is embarrassed to be around me because he is good looking, skinny. And fit.  Comments about the weight are almost daily. This tears me down so much and then I starve myself for 3 days and lose a few lbs and then slip again. I also have PCOS and it's harder for me to lose weight. My therapist put me on a medicine to stop the cravings but some days I forget to take it and then hate myself for forgetting. I dont know why I forget, my job is very stressful so it's hard to think straight or make it a priority.

The expectation is that I work 40 hrs a week and not miss days for FMLA, plus my job gives him insurance. So I can't lose that, also that i work out 5 days a week keep the house clean, meal prep, walk the dog, not be high maintenance (no fake eyelashes, nail appointments to waste $ like I used to when I was skinny) so that we have savings and investments. We also don't take any trips anymore so life consists of work, sleep, Comments about my weight and there is nothing to look forward to. I don't know how to keep up with all that. He gets a lot done and has some workaholic tendencies but says it's part of adult life it is what it is and what it takes the deal.

He has a big family in CO, we are going to visit and everyone is waiting for him but noone is waiting for me. . .I have no other family and he is the only one whose opinion matters the most but also whose opinion hurts the most... I don't feel pretty, which pushes me into more depression and I wake up very tired every day. I sometimes dont feel loved but I know he loves me because he tells me he does. Next morning he says: ""you've slept for 10 hrs there is no f reason to be so tired get up and do stuff....When I tell him I'm sorry I am disappointing him and I will try harder he says I'm just making excuses. I always feel pressure because I am scared to show my true feelings afraid of backlash to be told to just get over it and so I try to fake it till I make it and go through tremendous amount of anxiety to  push myself to do things but still it's not enough. I really do try to act as normal as possible and shove these feeling far away. I was thinking of making a checklist of everything I'm expected to do and try my best to just go for it.

I am concerned because lately I think more and more about needing to make a will. I am not suicidal I would never harm myself but I wish I could just hide somewhere in the corner and all these bad feeling would go away and I can come back strong, get stuff done and be happy. Like some sort of reset. He says he has given up on me and trying to pull my weight and drag me to the gym. That's absolutely heartbreaking. So I'm on my own, have to try to pick myself back up, get skinny, stay motivated as there isn't going to be more support. I get it. So many times I failed him when I go 3 days and then complain that my body hurts. 

I am stuck. I am very organized, really good at planning, very creative, I feel like there is a lot more to me than my weight  but I can't seem to get out of this endless cycle of hating myself, not having enough willpower to ""just get over it"" go to work full time, to gym, not eat my feelings, lose the weight and be back to the happy, good looking girl that he wants back. 😭 I just feel so worthless.

369,t3_dks0cz,I need some advice on getting a therapist.,"For the past year or so, I've (15M) been feeling like absolute shit. I quit football at the beginning of the school year, and then I broke my wrist shortly after. During that time, I gained a fair amount of weight, just because I couldn't exercise well with the cast on my arm.

This evening, I went to check my phone (I was only on it for about an hour that day), and she went on this long, guilt-tripping rant about how I'm on my phone too much. I got so angry, I did the only thing I could. I went downstairs to punch the punching bag for a couple minutes. She doesn't allow me to talk back or swear. She even counts ""frick"" as a swear word. 

I'm in the basement, punching the absolute fuck out of this bag, when she comes down. She starts talking to me about how I'm on my phone too much, and this eventually transitions into a lecture about my physical health. She says: ""you have been much less active this fall, and when lacrosse comes up, you're going to be out of shape.""

I told her that I got the connotation that she thought that I was getting out of shape/overweight, and she just says: ""Oh, I didn't mean it like that"". 

I've been feeling so down on myself for a while, and I think it might be time to get a therapist. I just want to confide in someone without that information being given to my parents or spread around school. But I don't know how my mom will respond, however. I don't know if she would just say: ""You shouldn't be feeling like this, you have a great life"" or if she will go all helicoptor mom and just be all: ""Oh no, my baby is sad! I'd better go to his therapist meetings just to make sure he's OK!""

370,t3_dkrzmf,"I feel like I have disfucntional or inefficient neural connections in my brain; I somehow turned them on, but I am not able to do it again. And knowing that what I am missing, and I can't have it again driving me insane.","A little bit of background story: 
I have been using Venlafaxine for the past 6 years (150mg for long time and 225mg for the past few years). My diagnosis was mild depression, obsessive sessions and anxiety; and since then I had up and downs, plateaus, twists and twirl; and somehow managed to survive, ended up studying and working abroad, involving in many event organisations and became an important member of my former schools Erasmus Student Network currently, and known by almost all incoming Erasmus students to my former uni. 

I studied biology/biotechnology; and accept my disorder as a physiological phenomena, caused by inefficient neuronal connections or insufficient neurotransmitter functionings. This and similar disorder symptoms in my family, makes me feel okay with long term medicine use as long as it keeps me functional. 

My first romantic interest was in the middle school, around the age of 12-13 and it was platonic; and it ended up with losing my self confidence, made me more concern about the authority figures ideas, giving wrong decision about myself and my future before starting the treatment. Since then I was mostly okay.

But mostly I was a quitter when it comes to the things related to myself. For example, I was very enthusiastic about playing electric guitar, my interest started to decline when I got it, and I only played/learned it by giving a proper credit for a year. Or when I was in a party, I was having instant down mood, and leaving the venue without looking back for a second while my friends inside. Or I was very into photography, I got my camera, took lots of nature and event pictures without any speciality, and it sits under my table for the past year. My interest to people also down for a long time. I was into them, but I knever had the thought or desire of ""Oh yea, I want to fuck her. "" whenever I was talking or flirting with someone. 

This come to my realisation and the reason why I'm writing this post. 

During a weekend camp with the Erasmus students, I shared a joint with a newcomer. I don't smoke that often and I can't smoke indica because of its after effect, down mood for a few weeks. I confirmed that it was a sativa hybrid, smoked, and went back to the main hall where the ice breaking games will be at. 

I was high, obviously, and I was acting like one. Once I notice that it was not a good impression of me, I decided to get my shit together, focus on my body, my posture, the way I walk, talk, take pictures and so on. 

After a while of trying to act normal, I started to feel something was not right and not good with the pictures I took. I was doing it completely wrong because I was focusing to the object, not to the frames. I mean, yes, I was taking pictures, but it has no uniqueness or quality when it comes to artwork. 

Meanwhile, when I was talking with the people, I noticed they were giving some body language signals I was not aware before, and much more attractive than before. I was desiring them, like, ""yeah she looks so nice, I want to flirt with her, and have a night stand (insert F word here instead)"". 

That inspiration and desire stayed up for 10-15 minutes, and faded away while laughing our asses off to the all chaos around us while people were playing the ice breaking games. I tried to brought it back, by trying to follow the same steps before I did, but it wasn't back at all. 

For the rest of the weekend, I took the pictures with the realisation I had, angles and frames that I never did before, and the results were pretty nice than it could be. 

Since then, I have been thinking that I have a broken pathway in my brain, due to not being used for long time, and I know that there are several post synaptic receptors and neurotransmitters involved in. I am not sure which ones exactly, but I was planning to ask to my doctor about it.

Until my appointment, I smoked more than usual, without knoeing some of them were indica. It kind of helped me realise that I am suffering from fear of missing out a lot, not caring about my basic needs, I am keep partying no matters what, including living with half trash room, not cooking and spending much more than I could afford, not having proper rest and so on. 

Long story short, Friday night was one of the best nights I could hang out with Erasmus students, that I will call them friends from now on, because I was organizing a pub crawl game, we were all together at the end point, happy, chatty, drunk and having so much fun. 

At a sudden, I felt a down mood and left with a few people, dropped my backpack to home, and went to a local place. I noticed multiple missing calls and messages from friends who were in the last pub when I was leaving, asking where I am, or wait for them. I sent one of them my location, she said they arrived after a while, but I didn't seen them and went back to home, drunk. In the morning, I noticed another text saying they were there for an hour already and asking where I was. I exchanged a few texts with everyone, sleept all day, went out on Saturday night, smoked a bit with friends then continued self discovery and sleeping for the rest of the weekend.

TLDR: Before I started writing this post, I was feeling so down, even thinking about suicide itself. I felt missing out, sad because of not having a proper connection with people in general, not being able to desire them, not being able to care about myself, feeling stuck in my brain and lost my connection with my body, concerned if I'm developing a kind of schizophrenia or a personality disorder, hating the fact that I have to go to work that I hate already, not being able to be around at friends and my university, not being able to know or want what to do in future, motivational issues, and lastly, noticing that my appointment with my psychiatrist was on last Wednesday.

372,t3_dkryby,How to stop exhausting my spouse with my mental health...,"I love my spouse so much. But I'm worried sometimes my mental illness is just exhausting for him.

I've been going through really low periods lately now that it's autumn and seems like it's dark outside all the time. I'm going through a really intense stressful period at work too and even working 60-70 hours a week doesn't seem like enough. I always feel inadequate and stupid and not good enough, and it's just eating at me. I've finally found a psychiatrist who accepts my insurance but that appointment is over a month away (the soonest I could get in).

My spouse has a similar job as mine so he is also stressed out. I try to keep on a happy face around him because I know it's too much to be stressed all day with work then have to go home to your spouse, i.e. me, who's crying in bed. If I can't manage a happy face, I just tell him that ""I'm working"" and go to the other side of our house so I won't be sad around him (and often I am working, lol, so not a lie). Sometimes I can't do that though, and I lose it and cry around him. He usually sighs and tells me his life is incredibly stressful too.

I feel so guilty that I'm making his life harder, but I also can't just hide from him all the time so he won't notice I'm depressed.

What do you do to put on a happy face at home and/or try to take the burden of your mental health off your spouse?

ETA - I would consider myself high-functioning, I work, manage to go to the rare social occasion, etc. I don't think many in my social group or coworkers would guess how bad I feel about myself all the time. I used to be able to get myself to do things that might make myself feel better, at least for a little while, but lately I can't find much in me except to go to work so I don't get fired. I generally do the dishes and do the laundry at home too. Used to cook but not anymore.",depression

374,t3_dkouij,I don’t know what to do anymore or who to talk to,"Hello everyone,

I am a 26 year old (M) and I truly feel that I am suffering from some sort of depression or emotional disorder. I don’t know how to resolve this or who to talk to. I need help.

To fill you in a bit on my life, I live at home with my mother and father and one sibling. Often times I feel smothered as I cannot have my own space nor any quiet time. I have some resentment towards my family for a few reasons. I don’t even want to be around them a lot anymore. It kills me I feel this way because I love them but it feels like I can’t stand them most times. I am usually never happy. Even when something good happens I don’t get too happy because it usually gets ruined or messes up somehow and I get my hopes up for nothing. I am single and haven’t had a relationship since I was in high school. I’ve always wanted to find a good woman and be with one but every time I talk to one I get ghosted or they get uninterested in me after time. It feels like no one wants me and there is something wrong with me. It makes me sick thinking that once people get to know who I am they want to mouse away. I’ve been through a lot of emotional and mental pin and stress in my life and although it’s gotten easier at times, the effects still remain with me to this day. There are times I just cry. I ask god why my life is the way it is and I try changing my perspective but nothing works. I feel empty. I am not struggling with finances. I have freedom. But it feels like I’m chained down and like I’m dying. I rarely have a good day and when I do I still can’t be happy or fulfilled. I don’t know what to do anymore. My heart hurts 24/7. My father is not too understanding about things and I don’t wanna our this in my family. I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have already have families. I feel so cold and alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I’m struggling, I’m suffering and I’m scared. If I wasn’t holding back tears right now I’d ball my eyes out writing this. I don’t have anyone I really want to talk to this about. Can anyone relate to my situation and offer any advice??

Thank you all and God bless",depression

I was willingly putting myself into a competitive work rut that would take me from my family.   And I am super competitive.  

But I am tired and I feel no joy.  My house is dirty.  I don’t have any friends.  Just work and some home stuff.  My husband is angry at me. 

At work I am the poster girl for extroverted positivity and as soon as I leave work my true introverted sad anxious self comes forward to spend the evening with me and my family. 

Varying degrees of this has been happening all my life.  But it feel so much worse now.  When I was younger being sad or depressed was dramatic.

Its like trying to climb a mountain with a ball and chain wrapped around your ankle. Depression is serious, its not an aesthetic. When you use depression as an aesthetic its just wrong. People kill themselves every day and you just use it for attention. The people who are actually struggling I pray for you.

394,t3_dkrigh,Being away on holiday has made me feel so much better. I go home tomorrow and I can already feel the suicidal thoughts coming back,"(BACKSTORY IF UR INTERESTED)

I've struggled with depression for quite a long time, since being an early teen (I'm in my early 20s now) at first it was the struggling to fit in and being unsure of the future, I guess what you'd call ""classic teenage depression"". Things started to get worse when I developed physical health issues. To cut a long story short, my school and people around me weren't very supportive and made things a lot harder than it had to be. I fought so hard through everything to complete my final exams with good grades so I could get into college/university. That didn't work out and I dropped out really quickly when I realised I couldn't cope and it made my health issues worse.

I managed to get my life together somewhat, moved back home, got a part time job, enrolled on a distance learning course and got myself an actual social life. This were pretty good for a year or so until my health got a lot worse, very quickly.

 I lost everything in about a month when I was diagnosed with a debilitating chronic illness with no cure and very little treatment. Things got worse before they got better but I did begin to make some progress towards getting my life back before being diagnosed again with a major issue with one of my vital organs that left me house bound and most of the time bed ridden. I had surgery that was thought to be successful until earlier this year I started having issues again and I was back to being housebound, useless and so fucking lonely. 

Months of shitty appts of doctors and various specialists basically telling me ""yes there is something wrong, but we don't know what it is and tbh don't care enough to investigate. Ur 10 mins is up now thanks"" took its toll on me as you can imagine. I see a therpist who is good to talk to but can't fix me. My local mental health team basically said they cant help me as im having private treatment. I'm stuck doing fuck all and I hate it so much. I've always been ambitious and to be stagnant like this fucking sucks so much and I want to die. I've gotten close to killing myself a few times but I'm a pussy who's scared and don't want to hurt my parents who try their best.

I had a major breakdown about a month ago and told my parents everything in a mess of tears and snot with a bit of yelling and screaming thrown in. I said i needed proper help and that I wanted to kill myself or run away but didn't want to end up on a mental health ward. We looked at some  private residential mental health treatments that I honestly think would help but would cost thousands and I cannot ask them to pay that as I know they would and I'd feel awful. We basically agreed that a short holiday away from everything would help me and booked a holiday to the middle of nowhere.

(PRESENT DAY AND SOMEWHAT OF A TLDR)

Being on holiday away from everything has helped me so much. I wasn't sure if i was pinning everything on it as being perfect and I know I'm not cured but the physical break has been great and I don't have to worry about all that shit at home. Things i was worried about don't seem as bad now and Ive relaxed for the first time in ages. 

The thing is we go home tomorrow. We've had our week break and now I need to go back and deal with things but I don't fucking know how. Ill be back to being house bound, stuck doing nothing and lonely. I know I should try go out and do things but it's so hard when you can't trust your body and you're not sure if you're going to pass out or end up in a hospital. I have no confidence to do anything or believe in myself as the person I once was was gone. I've tried so many options I don't know what's left and I'm scared after a few days of being back I'll go back to wanting to die and fucking hating everything.

398,t3_dko8t0,That ominous thought process inside my head that keeps screaming 'you will die alone',"Sometimes it's difficult to remind myself that it's just my loner mind making assumptions, I've still got some 50-60 years ahead of me and who knows what might happen, right? But these thoughts echo through my head more often than usually lately, what doesn't help my mom asking me if I have a girlfriend, to which I reluctantly answer 'no', or seeing former classmates getting engaged. I have reached a new low in self-hatred, fueled by jealousy at everyone else who is in a relationship.

It's got to the point where, even if I see memes that reference girls in any way, all of a sudden I get a flash reminder that I am a lonely loser, which thankfully doesn't stick and I forget about it in a few minutes. Sometimes I get close to feeling actual hatred, and isn't that wonderful? To irrationally hate two people who aren't responsible for my loneliness in any way? That's right, I'm that fucked in the head. But thankfully, I can keep all of this well locked within me, if I physically lashed out at anyone I would be embarassed to death, and the same goes for if anyone found out I'm like this. I usually keep my mouth shut, don't really talk to a lot of people about this. 

To be fair, I'm not really putting much effort in to change this, which would probably make me feel less like shit. Whenever I leave work, I get myself a beer, go home, do some chores around the yard if I have to and then spend the rest of the evening playing video games. This is pretty much what my routine is like since I've started working, I barely leave the house in my free time and I haven't met any new people in ages.

399,t3_dko7c8,How do I get rid of social anxiety?,"I have been socially retarded my entire life. When I was a little kid I thought I must secretly be a robot. I only realized recently that my anxiety is not the ""normal level"" that everyone deals with and it's not that I must just be bad at dealing with it. 

People often have a good first impression of me, but then when I start speaking their smile literally turns upside down. I can almost see the gears turning in their heads and pointing to ""LOW SOCIAL STATUS - AVOID!"". Some people make a conscious effort to overcome this gut reaction and they'll put in effort towards socializing with me. They'll even invite me to events, but that primal signal remains - they rarely laugh at my jokes (because laughing at my jokes would mean acknowledging me). Sometimes I will say something, quite audibly, in a conversation that I'm a part of - with 3 or more people, and everyone just ignores it as if I'm not there. This happens often. Again - it's not out of malice, or conscious malice anyway, people just feel they can/should ignore me. This behavior towards me is nearly universal - even my younger brother will have this reaction, although he makes an effort to acknowledge me. This has led me to minimizing contact with people.

I've developed a painful autoimmune disorder from the constant stress - felt like I was dying until I got steroids, and my speech has actually gotten a bit worse in the last 5 years - I will stutter a bit when I'm really stressed.

And now I am feeling the worst mental pain I have ever experienced. A month ago, a very cute girl in school showed interest in me, and I decided to follow through and just see how far I could take it, even though I immediately knew it wasn't ultimately going to go anywhere. It was the same pattern - the more interaction I had with her the more negative her disposition to me became. It was incredibly painful to see contempt on her face and realize I wasn't delivering what she expected of me, and to not know what I could do/say to make her laugh instead. This friday she asked me to come practice with her, and there was so much silence. I could not maintain a conversation. I've never heard her say ""creepy"" until today, and even though it wasn't in reference to me - it's still an association, and it was like a knife at my heart. No one has ever expressed interest in me like her before, and I have fucked it up. I walked her to her car with conversation more stilted than ever and asked - are you going to the class halloween party? and she drops the second ""no, halloween is creepy"" on me. Hasn't replied to my text, I'm pretty sure this thing is over.

I have been just lying in bed for the last two days with a hole in my soul. I don't have anyone to tell this to - so I've just been writing a very long journal entry all this time because it dulls the pain a bit.

I know that some people here have more serious problems but I have also never reached out like this before. The pain will not go away. This was as close to a relationship as I have ever had, and I am past my 20s.",depression
400,t3_dkrcly,Am I really that boring?,"About seven months ago, I moved to a different state about 3 1/2 hours away from my family. The change has been rough on me, and I've started going to therapy to work out some of my negative self talk. Well, I'm getting completely triggered right now and need some help. Apologies for mobile.

This weekend I visited my mom and expected to have a great time with her, catching up and taking some edibles together for a little fun. We've never done this before together, so I didn't know what to expect, but I have a lot more experience than my mom. I was feeling fine and asking my mom lots of questions, trying to prompt her to ask me some follow-ups. For instance:

Me: ""What have you been listening to or watching lately?""

Her: ""Oh, mostly The Woody Show, nothing new other than that.""

Me: ""yeah, me too, and I've been reading Rebecca for my book club, it's really interesting!""

Her: ""oh yeah.""

Me: [expecting some type of follow-up to keep the conversation going, like, 'what is the book about?' 'what do you like about it?,' etc]

**Dead silence until I bring up something else for just her to comment on**

This may just be an edible crash, which does happen to me, but I can't help feeling depressed about this. It's the exact thing that's got me in therapy and the main source of my negative self-image.  Do people just not want to ask me anything about myself? Am I that boring?  I try to have many things to talk about with others, I always ask questions, I try to prompt people with things about my life, and it just feels like people aren't engaged back with me or interested in getting to know me. Even my own mom doesn't ask me about my job, my husband, my cat, my friends, my interests, or my therapy.

When you actually open up your bottled up feelings, you make people uncomfortable and they don't  want to depend on you now. They will slowly disappear from your life or treat you like you are worthless or fuck you over in some way. 


What I came up as a solution for my problems (which is mainly whining a lot) is bottle up everything and do whatever I need to do in my life. Maybe here and there I open up partially to only a certain group of friends who opens up to me so that I have something as a leverage.


Trust me, a lot of people treated me as shit when I open up and became vulnerable. All the people I have opened up have disappeared from my life. Now when I interact with them I have changed my personality and seeing that I have changed they don't treat me as worthless. The thing is a lot of people have a lot of problems and if they opened up to me I would have done the same thing my friends did to me. It's only natural.


Now what a lot of people might suggest is see a therapist but here's the thing. I am a student from a developing country and frankly I can't afford to. What I can do however is not whine like a sissy and take things as it is and think about what I can do to change it. If I can't do anything about it, I just shouldn't care.

Now saying that, I don't have depression or anything. I mean I don't know it and I don't want to self diagnose it. It's just sometimes I feel down.


What I said here is just my opinion, feel free to fight me. It will be constructive and I might get corrected if I am wrong.",depression
408,t3_dkr6i0,Support I guess.,"I came here through a friend’s recommendation. I’m a 31 year old guy. I recently sold my business although not for a lot of money and now I find myself in fear of the future. 

I have always struggled with depression and currently take antidepressants. I talk to my psychiatrists on and off though not as regularly as I should. This recent change in my life has really had an effect on me and now I find myself drinking about half a bottle of whiskey every day. I’m not aggressive but I am in a bad mood constantly and get annoyed by everything my wife says or does, even though I know she doesn’t deserve that and I regret it afterwards making me even more depressed. 

I used to be quite sporty but I am also going through a shoulder injury so I can’t vent out in the gym. All my hobbies were sports related so I can’t do them anymore but even if I could I just don’t feel like doing anything. I watch tv or play video games and they just don’t fill the void. Everything seems phony or unimportant or just plain boring. 

I have never had suicidal thoughts, but I do feel like my life is meaningless and empty. It really doesn’t help that I am currently unemployed and have nothing at all to do all day, but at the same time I shudder at the thought of responsibility and human interaction. 

I don’t really know what I’m expecting to achieve by posting here, I guess I just needed to vent with someone who isn’t my therapist or a family member. Thanks.",depression
409,t3_dkr60x,X-post from r/offmychest: I'm learning to let go of other people's (and my own) expectations,"Even if it hurts me in the short term (like if I don't do as well as I'd want). Because NOTHING is worth wanting to give up.  


It might not be the most style of thinking of the most relentless people, but I don't care. I'm realizing that to me, expectations can be a bottomless pit of suffering. Of never enjoying what I've achieved. Of someone's offhand comment of 'you can do more' hurting me in my soul.   


Believe in myself. Stop doubting that I'm not 'good enough'. I'm not naturally inclined to 'be lazy'. I have scars of years of trauma that slow me down. Change my view on life. That normal people with a normal childhood don't need to face every single second. And that's okay, I can be happy for them even if they don't understand. But I don't need to let their judgement get to me. And if they insist on throwing their standards in my face again and again then they aren't people I'd want to be around.  


It's not easy. A part of me that wishes I was unscathed will always look at that fruit I can never reach. When i think about how much simpler life must be for other people. Not living in deep hurt everyday. Seeing people zoom ahead because they don't have my baggage of having to pace myself. But I am beautiful in my own way. Going slow means i get to smell the flowers sometimes. Help others like myself. And I think that's worth the price of not being the highest scorer.

Been depressed a lot, short-tempted guy,introvert, mostly pf insecurities, have panic attacks mostly, feel like want to eat but have no appetite to eat,have no interest in almost anything. 


My family is not understanding my situation well. I mean, my mom knows I have depression problems, she helps me with taking anti-depressants but she is not accepting the fact that I have depression, she thinks that all these depression problems, I made it up in my mind to become depressed and literally we have a lot of fights based on this. I tried a lot to explain it much but she never accepts the fact that college, college environment, toxic friends,etc. can cause stress and depression.


Besides this, there is this another problem. My sister, sooner or later, will get married. My family wants me to help out with the marriage works and other stuffs. And like so, my mom is strict. And when it comes to the works, there might be situations where I have to decide something and I haven't decided about anything for literally my whole life because all the decisions that I made, it made my mom angry. And besides that, I do have panic attacks when I keep thinking about the social gatherings, where I have to meet all these people who I barely know 


 I thought about telling different reasons for not attending the marriage like I'm fed up with college stuff and it's difficult to come at the moment.

415,t3_dkr2h1,I feel terrible,"I generally feel terrible. It all started back when I started to study the first time. Everyone around me were doing fine academically. I was doing terribly. I didn't understand a single thing we were working on and even though I tried my ass off to understand. I really worked for it, but I just couldn't wrap my head around any of it. When the finals came around I started having panic attacks on a daily basis and most of the time it was multiple times a day. I had talks with a educational psychologist and I was diagnosed with depression. We both ended up agreeing on the right course of action was to drop out and ""find myself"" to figure out the right path of education that was for me (Education is free here so yeah that helps). So I did. I started smoking after a couple of weeks into the education I dropped out from because I couldn't handle the stress and pressure.

I ended up spending 5-6 months doing absolutely nothing. I slept until 3 in the afternoon everyday, and played videogames long into the night and just repeated that every day in those 5-6 months. For some that might sound so good and that I have nothing to complain about, but on the inside I just grew more and more tired of myself. I was running from any thought of responsibility. I was scared of anyone having requirements of me. I still am to be completely honest.

I finally had enough of doing nothing and started on a ""production-school"" that we have here. We did some interesting projects and it was actually okay for a change. I still felt terribly about myself in secret, but it was a time where I didn't constantly think about how bad everything was for me when I was at school. But I still felt mentally drained when I came home so all I could muster to do with myself was sleep until dinner was ready, so a solid 2 hours or so. I was there for a year because that's the longest time they allow a student to be there since you don't get an education or anything for being there. It's strictly for people that doesn't know what they want to do in life.

I left that school about 4 months ago and during the time from then till now I have actually tried to get a job, but no one wants to hire me since I have no experience in anything and I have no education at the age of 21. I am starting on an education that focuses on people who ""aren't ready"" for a regular education and I don't know how I feel about it yet. All I know is that for the last couple of years I have felt nothing but terribly about myself. I have on multiple occasions had to ask for money from my mother to pay for something as simple as my phone bill and that is not helping me feel better about myself. To be completely honest I have on so many occasions considered myself a waste of life. I have not considered suicide as some people do, since I still have some wonderful things in my life. I love my family and my friends to death. My friends are always there for me and they know how I feel so they are very supportive.

So all in all, I still feel terrible all the time, but it's the worst at night. I can't seem to find the right place for me in this world and I kinda feel like I don't want to die, but I don't wan't to live either. Everything since my 18th birthday till now has only done bad things for me. I can't see where I am going. Everything ahead of me is in utter darkness. I have started multiple things and given up because I am not strong enough to handle the pain and stress that it brings. All my friends have regular jobs, girlfriends, apartments and is starting their adult lives and I still sit here in my dark hole with nothing to give me the slightest of happiness. I have kinda forgotten how it feels to be happy. I don't know anything anymore. Something that has also been beating my brain to pieces is that to live you need to work. You literally work to live and I can't seem to agree with that. Money control the way you live and if you don't get any money you're doomed. I just can't fathom how people does it and I don't want to be apart of it. I see that I have to, but I don't want to. I just don't know how to live.",depression

420,t3_dkqzsy,I need to let this out. I have nobody to tell it to anyways.,"About a year ago, my social life fell apart. It's not like i've been lonely all my life; i've had very large groups of friends in elementary and the first two years of middle school. But after 7th grade, my family and i moved. Something just triggered me to... put myself in a bubble, and i suddenly wouldn't let anybody in. Even my own family. This ""something"" is when i told them i was suicidal due to my parents fighting all the time, and instead of giving me the love and attention i was trying to ask for, they did the opposite and even beat me up. My parents also almost divorced 3 times in a single summer. So that's one part of this.
What happened next is what brought me here. 8th grade started, and i just moved so i know nobody. Usually, within the first few weeks, i get someone to be interested in me and we become friends. This has happened every single time i move to a new school, which has happened a lot. However, because of this bubble, i guess people could tell that i wasn't a good person? Every night i'd ask myself, looking in the mirror, ""why don't people like me?"" Every morning i'd wake up thinking someone would try to be my friend. But it never happened. Every day, this 13 y/o smart girl who definitely was an interesting and beautiful person would sit by herself at lunch, do all her work on her own, stand in the corner all the time, and always be alone.
Then, we moved again, which was about 6 months ago. I recently started high school, just turned 14, and i hoped, like how everyone always says, that everyone is new so everyone is looking for a friend. Bull. Its been about 3 months since school started, and guess what. I'm still alone. I'm still being ignored, and i still have confidence problems so even if i wanted to ""put myself out there"" i'd fail miserably.
Is it because i'm not incredibly skinny like all the other girls at school? Is it because i know nothing about makeup? Is it because i exist? I just want to be acknowledged. I've been alone for too long now. I just wish i had somebody. My parents will either call me weak or beat me up again. My old friends don't like me anymore because i'm ""too depressing."" My counselors or teachers will just get my parents involved. Even the person who i would say i'm the closest to, my sister, tells me to kms everyday. I just want at least one person to say hi to me in the hallways during break, or hug me when i look like i'm about to cry (all the time), or talk about our favorite tv shows. I want someone to tell me i AM beautiful and i am NOT fat and i AM interesting. I want a genuine caring human being that won't try to ruin my life and fill this hole in my heart. When i cry, i don't even feel anything anymore. The only thing that keeps me from ending it all are my video games. Is there even any hope for me at this point?",depression
421,t3_dkltvq,I have no motivation. (18M),"I've just finished my final year in high school and after wanting school to be over for the past two years, I expected my life to get a lot better without school. Unfortunately, the opposite has happened. Whenever I get time to think, my thoughts are always negative. I have dealt with mental health issues in the past (Very bad anxiety) but never did I think I'd feel depressed.

Since school has finished I have had a lot of free time. Everyone around me tells me to ""get a job"", ""learn how to drive"" or ""get a hobby"" but I don't feel like that. I'm not motivated to do anything. I don't want to be around anyone. I sleep for probably 14 hours a day. I've tried to get a job, I've applied for a few online with no success. I've tried to get a hobby, but anything I do I get bored of in a week's time. I just feel useless at everything. 

I have friends, a girlfriend and a nice family but I feel like the biggest burden to them. My friends always pick me up and drive me around, wasting a lot of money on fuel and a lot of time. Most of the time I don't even want to see them I just do it because I'd be doing nothing else otherwise. My parents spend so much money on me and I feel like I can't give anything back to them because all I am is a dead weight that occupies a room in their house. 

I have no idea what I want to do with myself. I just want to be alone but I don't know why. I hate having to own up to my responsibilities. I hate having think about growing up and being an adult, getting a job, move out of home. If I tell anyone this, they just reply with ""why don't you just get a job"" or ""it's easy, just do ___"" and for a brief moment I think, you know what I'll do that and then a few moments later I just can't be bothered again.

My attitude gets me into a lot of shit. My relationship with my girlfriend is a lot worse. I don't see my friends much anymore. When I get mad/sad I often lash out or blaming people for my own actions or blowing very small things way out of proportion. Very petty arguments but still, weakening relationships.

425,t3_dkqtg0,I don't understand.,"Today I thought seriously about tying a rope up to my ceiling fan.  I know no one here really has the capacity to help me, I just wanna talk a little.  


I know my own depression like a memorized book.  One thing that seems particularly cruel to me is, well... I've realized that I go through periods of about 3 days of good, and then 4-5 of bad, but that the periods of good are simply... Lies. They're the exception to the baseline.  They're a result of the face i have to put on for the world.  How can I enjoy lies?


These oases of good are so good that during them I often wonder how it was that I could ever have let myself get so down just a few days before.  I know that in a few days I will be looking back to today, perhaps I will look at that rope on the counter, and I will wonder what could have possibly gotten into me.  Life will seem untemporarily good, like *that* is the baseline. And not the way around, not the way it actually is.


I am not devoid of logic.  How could I not consider that if I feel that way in the Up swings, I would also know that my Down swings are temporary.  And, admittedly, they are temporary. However, since the Down swings last longer, and considering how I've been unhappy for atleast the last 10 years, then... I'm inclined to claim that they're the baseline, not the Ups.  


I am immensely afraid, perhaps moreso than I've ever been of anything, of... The possibility of nothingness.  No consciousness ever again.  For eternity.  This could be our only chance of experiencing anything. I am not religious, I am not atheist. But I do know that the likelyhood of suicide surpasses this fear, and I don't know why.  


For me, I know exactly why I'm sad, but I can't do anything about it.  I don't think I'm the type of person to become addicted to the sadness. I just think, or know, that I'll never be able to fix it because the effort required to do so will always exceed what I'm capable of exerting.  


Think of a chubby kid in the freshman football team, the kind of kid that the rest of the team secretly hated because he could never keep up.  He would constantly be getting yelled at by the coach, and the team would always be suffering reprimands for his failings.  I'm the fat kid, except it's life and not football and I'm not overweight.  The coach is me, or my conscience being in eternal war with myself to get me to do the things I need to do.  The team is everyone in my life who's suffered as a result of my depression and bad decisions.  


Sometimes that chubby kid pulls through, gets his act together, and by senior year he's a capable member of the team.  But most of the time he just gets kicked off the team.  


I cannot adjust to what's required of society.  I can't pull my own weight, even for just myself.  If I don't kill myself, I will be in poverty for the rest of my life.

437,t3_dkql3k,My mom doesn't want to recognize I went through depression,"TL;DR Mother doesn't want me to say I was depressed to other people and doesn't believe I ever was.

My (30F) mother is this incredibly strong woman. Mentally and physically. She went through so much in life and I admired her for a long time. But because of that, she thinks that since she is strong and since she made me, that I'm as strong as her, and I know I'm not. I'm not physically strong and I frankly don't care. I'm not mentally strong and I'm okay with that, everyone is different. (Well technically she never succeeded in stopping smoking while it took me less than a year to go full vegan so I'm probably stronger than her on willpower? Not saying that people who can't stop smoking don't have willpower, just saying that in her case, when she's always saying that she's strong mentally, it's weird she's still addicted to tobacco.)

Anyway, I left home when I was 21 to study in another country and I never returned except for holidays. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years later and got prescribed antidepressants, which I never took because I didn't want to rely on drugs to get better. I was in depression for three years and then a final year where I was more or less okay. I was sad, sick with sicknesses (got the flu and bronchitis together at the same time three times between January and April of my worst year) all the time, I felt broken and lost. Without direction. I wanted to cry all the time. It was bad. But I wasn't living with my mom so she never saw me in that state. She knew I had been diagnosed as depressed but for her it wasn't a sickness, more like a state of mind that one can choose to be in or out.

Well I finally got out and I'm good. 

Now, years later, I don't talk a lot about this dark time but sometimes it comes up in conversations and I share my story. Last time was Christmas 2017, my mother's friend was talking about it because her niece had been diagnosed and since I knew the friend well as well as her niece, I talked about my own experience. Cue my mother overhearing me and coming to cut me while I'm talking and asking me to go check something in the kitchen. As I go,I overheard her saying to her friend to not believe what I just said, that I wasn't diagnosed, that it wasn't depression, it was just that I was sad. I didn't confront her on the spot because that's not how I roll but almost two years have passed and I still don't understand why she said that. I asked her about it and she legit told me she doesn't believe I went through depression.

I'm sick of it. She never wants to hear about my physical struggles because in her opinion, I'm this perfect child that came out of her and if she's strong, then that means 100% sure that I'm strong also. I have been wondering why she's like that with me. My brother (28) doesn't have to endure that. She never minimized something he went through. But according to her, I wasn't depressed, I don't have asthma (her excuse on this is that everyone in the world has asthma and some have it more severe than others), I can't be gluten intolerant (which I'm still trying to figure out), all because I came out of her.

I don't know how to react to this. I want to address the problem. I want her to stop minimizing my problems. It's like she doesn't want to admit that her daughter has weaknesses, but it's not weaknesses in my eyes. I went through depression, and in my opinion it makes me stronger than I was before. I have asthma, so I always carry my inhaler with me, and thank God I was diagnosed because I was really starting to worry about my shortness of breath and the inside pains. I might be gluten intolerant and it would be good to know it for sure, so that I could try to eat healthier and take better care of my body.

All this started when my mother told me she didn't believe I was ever depressed. After she said that, every time she said something similar, I made an internal note on it. She probably said similar things when I was a kid but apart from the asthma thing, I don't remember a lot.

Do any of you have a similar experience? A parent telling you there is nothing wrong with you? Someone close to you saying that depression is not that important ? I'm here wondering why she's like that.",depression

440,t3_dkqj1g,Depression and acid this is my story,"I feel like acid broke my brain, but I know it didn’t actually “break” it. Let's back this up 4 years to freshman year of high school.

I was as happy as could be, I had all the friends the school had to offer but I was nervous to make a move on girls.I was actually pretty good at making friends with girls but I was too afraid of rejection to make a move. Looking back, I failed to capitalize on numerous opportunities with girls.

 Sophomore year my best friend got a girlfriend that he is still with today, very impressive right. She essentially took him away from in terms of people I was super close with. It was around the same time a bad influence took me into the world of drugs in the form of marijuana. Because of underlying issues involving my dysfunctional family, or totally unemotional dad, weed was love at first sight. I didn't know at the time but I used weed to replace a lot of the good feelings I was lacking(I was pretty much high everyday all day until I got to college).

 I slowly became more and more depressed and lost more and more motivation to exercise, eat well, hold a job and get hours. but my depression was easy to hide from myself and others because there were good things in my life I could look at in hard times.

 Fast forward to the senior prom and I still nothing much has changed, I have never kissed a girl or made much progress in my life. I skipped out on prom not because I couldn't get a date but because for whatever reason I was too cool for it. I still made the “trip” to an air bnb with all my friends for prom weekend. 

We arrived at the house on friday and a couple of my more adventurous friends were taking acid that day. I had taken it twice before, and had a pretty good time but those first two times I took half tabs. This time I took a tab of about 170 ug and proceeded to have a hell trip about how my problems stem from having a bad relationship with my dad in childhood, including girls, laziness, weed addiction etc. 

The whole weekend for me pretty much turned into me staying to myself Ever since about six months now I have been really depressed and developed a crippling social anxiety out of nowhere, I have isolated myself from everyone, including family and friends. Whenever I'm with them I can’t have a good time and I feel like they treat me like a depressed friend which is considerate but ultimately just reinforces it.

 In college I made a couple friends but they're from a different building and for some reason I try to avoid them as much as possible. I don't interact with my roommate very much besides talking about sports here and there, and I pretty much never talk to the other kids in my hall. This is the story that im too afraid to talk to anyone in person about so I'm posting it to reddit to take some of that pressure off.

Tomorrow I am going to college to continue degree in IT but thb I am not so sure do I really want this? I don’t know why I am so scare. Maybe bcuz I am afraid of failure? I been always goods in my grades, just good but not the best one. 

Maybe that’s why my family and I thought I am smart? Maybe it gives me an illusion that I can be in IT field or become successful in career and earn lots of money? 

But now I strongly doubt myself maybe I am not smart at all, its all fake, maybe this time I will fail terribly and huge in debts. Maybe I shouldn’t take the risk maybe I should have just go n get a job, work and tell my heart to stay quiet and don’t think too much. Just shut up!

But if I go to work, I don’t know what kind of jobs I should apply. Will the end all be the same whether I go study or not?

I will still end up the same life cycle, go to work, get back home and repeats and pray weekend come faster. Why everyone is doing this? Is there another way to escape this “structure” life?

A little background: I am a student who goes to a top college, thankfully gets financial aid to the point where I don't really have to worry about expenses, have pretty good grades, and have friends I really love.

I feel like I'm never actually happy here either...It's like a cloud that clears momentarily when I'm out with friends, but that returns as soon as I get back to my room and have to slog through all my assignments.

445,t3_dkn39w,My depression,"When I sit down to think about it, I began to notice my experiences with depression from about fifteen, I didn't know it for what it was until I was in my early twenties and was not officially diagnosed till the age of 26. I just thought that I was pessimistic, lazy and had low self-esteem and that was just who I was. I mean, it takes all sorts to make up the world and this was my lot.
I thought that, with enough hard work, I could change myself, could become a fitter, happier, more productive member of society. Me but just a better all round version of it. The more I fought to become the person I wanted to be, the more and more I felt like a failure. The more I felt the lower feelings of self worth. When this hit rock bottom I found it difficult to speak to others as I had a running inner monologue saying “you have nothing to say, this person is humouring your stupidity”. It seemed like every time I began to see change, I would get “the fear” and either withdraw or sabotage myself somehow on both professional and personal levels.
I know the opportunities were there for me in my youth to live life the way it is meant to be lived, or my perception of it anyway, but due to my illness I was robbed of the confidence to take those chances.
Naturally, my self-esteem only worsened as guilt and shame weighed heavy and for me one of the hardest cycles to break is the lack of motivation and the shame of not doing what should be done. 
My depression has two modes. My “everyday depression” and my “smacked to the floor no one gets out her alive depression”. The everyday version is a constant sadness that allows moments of happiness and can put a smile on my face but does not permit a smile in my heart. I can continue my day to day task for the best part but because I feel broken, I can’t build relationships with other humans. My severe depression stops me in my tracks and is there on my face for all to see if they looked. I struggle to hold a coherent thought, have any kind of productivity to my time and have seen myself lay bed for 2 days without eating until the pain in my stomach was to great and I had to eat.

It was only when I hit the lowest of lows that I began to question why it was that I just could not seem to be happy, and a sneaking suspicion began to grow. Perhaps my lack of energy and motivation weren't a result of my own laziness. Perhaps my unhappiness wasn't my own fault. 

I could not speak to family and friends about this due to the stigma attached but when I first broached the topic of depression with anyone it was with a doctor, I remember saying, ""I can't ever think of a time when I was a happy person. I just occasionally happened to have happy days."" And to this day, that statement holds true. I do have happy days — days in which I feel motivated, driven, passionate, and enthralled by possibility. They often get lost among the days in which I feel hollow, desperate in my despair. Depression; it at once thrilled me to have a name for my daily struggle and terrified me to the bone. How was I ever to achieve anything, to find happiness, if my mental illness stood in the way?

Some days, I still feel there is no hope and others I have ideas to create new plan, find a hobby and have a to do list for my work-in-progress, yet all of this went down the drain because I wake up on a  morning and I simply... can’t.

This is all I can write just now.

Sorry, no happy ending here as I feel there is just no hope to live a life without my dark clouds. 

Hope anyone who reads this gets what they need today to make it to tomorrow.

Hey, guys. For the past 5 days I have completely isolated myself from the world. I have severe depression so I don't have much energy and I just stagnate all the time. I have been sitting in my one room apartment, basically between four walls, for five days. I haven't showed, I barely ate something and  I feel like I'm losing my mind. Everything night I have constant horrendous nightmares (probably from overthinking and stressing out so much) and I feel like I'm about to crack. My family lives in another city so when we talk I pretend I'm fine, professional help is kinda out of the question right now due to financial issues and I can't really open up to them even tho I did try, they didn't understand. Friends care, but, you know, have their own lives and are busy. So, all of this is pushing me to the edge. The more I isolate the more anxious I feel to do anything - go outside, go to the store, go to college (which I'm already fucking up real hard).

So, not to make it too long, I wanted to ask if anyone has any tips or has been in a similar situation and could provide a little bit of help. Much needed. Thank you.",depression

452,t3_dkl7c1,Nostalgia,"On 2nd February 2019, my favourite person in the world whom I adored, my brother had a serious accident giving him tbi and changing his attitude and behaviour. He is 22 and had gone for a vacation with his friends. He had taken a cab at night and the driver was half asleep. My brother and his friends kept on telling him that they weren't in a rush and that he can take a break from driving but he insisted otherwise. Early in the morning, the driver fell asleep and the accident happened. Only my brother got serious injuries, the others getting a few scratches.

We were like the bestest of friends, we never fought, we played together and we laughed together. He was like the best person I could ask for. I loved him the most. 

Now however, he stays annoyed by me always and makes sure to keep a straight face whenever he is with me. He is the exact opposite of what he used to be. When he was in the hospital I used to cry my eyes out, just hoping for him to recover. He did not deserve any of what happened to him. He hadn't even sworn to anyone yet I'm sure! He was the pinnacle of kindness. He was studious and serious, and never disappointed.

During the accident, none of his friends in the car suffered even a fracture, my brother however suffered the most just because he sat in the wrong car at the wrong time and because the driver was half asleep and ran away after the accident.

Now I always have a gut feeling that it is not my brother in his body, rather it is someone who is the exact of opposite of him. I feel like our good memories are being washed away and are being replaced by these terrible ones. 

Whenever I see myself in old pictures or anything before February, I always wish I could go back to that time and spend just one day with my old brother and save him. Each day there is always the thought of me and my old brother in the back of my head all the time stopping me from focusing. I am unable to look at old pictures without having the gut wrenching feeling that somehow I'm responsible for this happening and how I lucky I was at that time without realising it. I feel very jealous of my past self. 2016-18 were the best years of my life and I loved my brother the most during that time. My life was also the best, with me having my favourite friends and memories made then.
 
Now I just keep on thinking in my head if there was a possible way to save my brother at that time. I somehow had a gut feeling before he went for his vacation that something was going to go wrong.

So coming to the point, I experience severe nostalgia everyday and almost all the time, I watch TV shows and play games to escape this empty feeling and as soon as I have to study or read, I'm back to feeling low. This has caused my academic performance and happiness to go down by a lot and I am not a fan of this.

What I do now is just avoid him in general, I avoid talking to him or seeing him because just the thought of him being the person I used to love causes many traumatic memories and sleepless nights.

Whenever I see something I did before February or with my brother, I always go into deep thoughts and wish that somehow I would be transported back to that time. I would do anything to save him. 

Ever since the accident, I have also been worried about my family's financial condition as I am not from a rich family, and the hospital expenses were a lot. After that, my grandfather has also been taking frequent trips to the hospital, so that is another expense that must be draining the money we have.

I just wish there was some way I could move on and realise I'm not getting my old brother back, and if one of you can give advice, I'd appreciate it.

I'm sorry if I brought your mood down.

I started treatment with 100mg sertraline which over the next month proved to make a huge improvement in my coping ability. 

A year later and I slowly found myself unable to cope again. Unnatural thoughts of wanting to be dead started popping in my head daily. 

I was then prescribed adderall in addition to the sertraline which once we landed on the 30mg extended release I was feeling normal! It was amazing feeling happy and excited about my life and everything I was experiencing. I could concentrate on tasks and see them through to the end. I did not have any feelings of inadequacy or worthlessness and it was amazing. I couldn’t believe how wonderful it felt. It really made me realize how disfunctional I was. There was this whit and black distinction to me of how I should be feeling and how I should not be feeling. For about 6 months I had been feeling great.

Now I have been noticing that even with being consistent with taking my medications I am starting to slip again. I am having more bad days, my weekends are starting to become non motivated and sluggish. I am feeling worthless and inadequate again and am terrified of the depression fog as it starts to creep back into my life.

After hanging out for about half an hour more because I didn't want them to think I was hurt, I texted my brother to call me and make an excuse so I can leave. And I left, went home and played games until I went to sleep.  
Now I'm thinking of every FUCKING time I felt this way and realise, it was always true, no one actually had the balls the actually say it until yesterday. I always knew it but chose to ignore it. I told myself ""no tolstonnee, people enjoy your company and they don't just use you for laughs""  
Screw people and socialising.  
I'm sad and I feel worthless.  I hate feeling like this.  
And the worst part is I have to see them at school and I'm probably gonna act like nothing is wrong but I know everything is wrong, I don't want to talk to them, I wanna leave the group chats and so on. I hate trying to form actual bonds with people when everytime this repeats. Fuck.This.Shit.

458,t3_dkq613,How do I change? How can I stop being a completely toxic monster?,"I don't know what to do. This isn't who I am. I used to be kind, and helpful, even when people were less than considerate about me. I've either been stabbed in the back by everyone I considered a friend, or just totally forgotten about like I don't exist, other than when they want or need something from me. I've often felt like the only people that want to be my ""friends"" are people that want to fuck me, or use me in some nefarious way. I've stopped having any faith in people. I don't feel like I ever really had trust in people to begin with, due to some traumatic events in my childhood. I often feel like 99.9% of humanity is garbage. 

Somewhere along the line, I just stopped caring about being a good person. I've adopted this total, douchebag persona, act like jerk, like I don't care...and it's just hurting me even more. I HATE what I've become. My fianceé today told me that I was the root of my own loneliness, and that I've become a dick to other people. It hurt me more than anything in a long time. Because it's true. I cut myself off from everyone, and gave up on having friends.

And now, in the rare instances when try to socialize, I distance myself from everyone by being a total asshole, even if it's not directly. I can't bother to find the effort to try and be nice, or to find anything nice about other people. Everything I say comes out rude, dick-ish, and often, hurtful. 

Partially, I'm doing this on purpose. I don't want to be close to people anymore. I don't want to be hurt. I don't want to have my life defiled anymore by fake friends, fake people, people who just want to use me. I plant distance between people and myself, by pre-disliking them, pre-hating them, even before we get to know each other. I thought if I put up these walls, no one can get in and make me hurt. But this approach is hurting me even more. I've expanded my loneliness tenfold, by rejecting my humanity.

I want to feel human. I feel like I'm undead. Devoid of social connection, devoid of life, devoid of happiness,  devoid of feelings that aren't disgust and hatred. All I'm capable of doing is hating people anymore. I don't want to be like this. I want to change. Learn to trust people. Learn to have friends. Learn to love people. Learn to HAVE CONNECTIONS. I'm tired of feeling nothing but revulsion and disdain for people when I don't even know them.

473,t3_dkkrdw,I haven't been happy,"This is hard to write, I feel like it's a tough subject and I haven't been able to say it properly, but it's been at least two months already since I've been feeling like this, so here it goes.

I haven't been happy since the start of the year. Sure, I have had a couple of happy moments, but as soon as that ends, I tend to feel miserable again and back to hating myself, I just generally feel without energy and almost never wanna do stuff, but well, I have to. I suffer from depression and anxiety (got to be honest, I think I do, I've never been diagnosed but I'm almost positive I exhibit the symptoms).

I guess it all has to do with the fact that I started going to university this year. I graduated high school last year and I really really liked it there, I felt happy the last couple of years, it felt like a home, with my friends, the teachers, it felt like a wonderful place. But now I'm in uni, one of the best ones in my country, but I just have never felt happy there. It's not about academic stress, I've gotten good grades so far and I like the career I'm in (art history), but I just don't feel like I belong there, I feel a lot of anxiety, I spend most of my time alone, and I really have trouble getting close to people, since I have social anxiety and I just feel different. As I said before, I like my career, but I don't see a future, I don't think it's going anywhere and I don't feel happy. I used to have long term goals and I used to know where I was headed to, but now I'm just doing things by pure inertia and I just can't find myself.

I miss the happiness, I miss feeling in a place where I belong, and I've simply don't see myself feeling any different in the future. This has led me to think about ending my own life because I feel I've lost myself, I can't find real happiness and I really don't anything right now. I've talked to some of my closest high school friends (I'm not close to my family, so I don't really trust them and I've never talked about my emotions with them) but it goes always the same, it turns into an awkward situation, they don't what to say (I don't judge them, it's a difficult topic to handle), we say goodbye and then it's never brought up again and it's like it never happened. This has led me to remain more closed and I really don't tell anyone anymore. Also, I know all my friends are happy, they have found their place, they have found new people, a career they like even with all the stress, so I simply do not wanna be a burden and take them back, because they have already moved on mostly. I've been thinking of seeing a therapist or something, but I can't work up the nerve to do so, and I really don't think I would open up so easy to someone I don't trust.

I don't really know what to do, I've also been thinking about dropping out from uni or taking a semester off, but I don't know, I would feel like a deception, my parents have spent a lot of money already, everyone is set in their new life, and I feel like I would be like that kid that doesn't know what to do, because let's be honest, everyone talks about the dropout who couldn't find its place, it's a thing our society does. But even if I take a semester off or something, I don't know what I would do, I would probably end up laying around being sad, and even if I find something new that I like, I'm scared it will be art history all over again, something I was sure about and now I'm here. Sometimes I watch a movie or something and I forget about all of this, but then I think about all of the things I have to do and my life feels like a downside again.

Killing myself feels like the easier route because I don't want to feel like this, feel this pain anymore, I don't want this horrible uncertainty, I've thought for at least to months about just ending it all. I haven't done it yet because I'm a coward, and because I feel there are some people that would be really hurt (my grandmas, a couple of my friends). I hate myself for feeling this lonely, for not being able to just talk to new people, for not being able to feel happy, I just hate me and have been thinking about harming myself, just ending it.

475,t3_dkib76,How do I (21m) get out of a depression after recently having broken up with my gf in a city where I don't have friends?,"My first gf broke up with me about two months ago. She's moved on, started university, got a new boyfriend and blocked me everywhere. I still think about her every day and am experiencing a variety of emotions from anger to loneliness to confusion to rejection. 

I've been living in a new city (Munich) for a good work opportunity for 7 months now but haven't made any friends. I was always fine with that because on weekdays I would work and weekends I would visit my gf or she would visit me. Now I feel so alone and rejected. My parents and childhood friends all still live in my home country and the people from my country who do live in the same city as me have ignored me after having reached out to them multiple times. 

All I do to do to keep my mind off things is call my sister, parents and friends from my country daily. On weekends its especially bad because I don't have anyone or anything to do. I do everything I need to do e.g. washing, cooking, cleaning, going to gym (when I'm up for it) but I still feel lonely and alone with my thoughts about my ex girlfriend. 

I keep thinking about how I can get her back (which is ridiculous, I know), what she's doing, if she still cares about me etc. Its very draining but I can't stop myself. 

Its so difficult to find people in my city (Munich) whom I connect with really well because 

1. Its a different country and therefore mentality

2. The people here are very clique-y - they only hang out with their own groups and childhood or university friends

3. People at work aren't interested in after work drinks or getting to know each other better.

This has been my and other people's who have lived here experience in this city. I've been to a couple of [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) events, which were nice and got my mind off things but I didn't make any meaningful connections with people. I know that I should just keep on trying and going to places but I hate the idea of such a huge challenge with such a low success rate. Maybe I'm just being pessimistic idk. 

Quite frankly I feel thrown away and left to make a huge amount of effort to meet friends and/or a gf in a foreign country where I'm on my own. 

Before I met my girlfriend I was also living alone in this foreign country in a city where I had made good friends. But I was still looking for a girlfriend because I really love giving love and being myself with someone. When I was in a relationship I was the happiest guy in the world. She was hot, loving, didn't judge my looks or style, goofy and funny. It ended because I let a lot of other factors like work stress and bad friends affect who I was and thereby how I treated her. I can't believe I lost her and it has been my biggest mistake ever. I know I'll eventually meet someone new, but it just feels so impossible in a place where the people have a different mindset and are difficult to connect with and when I have a mild depression and anxiety. 

A week ago I visited Vienna and it truly made me feel like I was over the breakup because a family friend was showing me around the city, giving me advice about the relationship and was just being there for me. But as soon as I got back I started feeling really lonely again. 

I'm also starting to call therapists so that I can tackle these issues and improve myself as a person. I would start a hobby but I might get transferred to Vienna at the end of the year (which I'm also stressing about a little bit) - so it would be pointless starting something now. 

My bottom line is: what do I do to get me out of this depression and over my ex in my situation? ""Keeping busy"" is better than doing nothing but I still think about everything when I'm busy because most of the time its just me. I just don't have motivation to do anything and only do the necessities.

Tl:dr: Im in foreign country and city where I know noone and feel very lonely all the time. Despite making an effort to meet people its still very difficult and I don't know what to do.",depression

479,t3_dkpi4n,I live in a trap house now and can't leave anytime soon,"**S.O.S PLEASE SOMEONE READ THIS**

I was clean and sober for 2 months, but the mental health facility I was at decided they didn't want to keep me anymore and my mom/step-dad kicked me out in August. So, out of pure panic that I would become homeless and not being able to find cheap housing, I decided to turn to an app kind of like Craigslist and find someone I could buy dope for in exchange for a place to stay. We would obviously share the meth, and it only costs me $200 a month to do this and stay here which at the time seemed worth it. Of course I found someone (this guy and some girl he's friends with that has a kid) who decided to give it a shot. However, I'm scared shitless and can't even cry because my fight/flight is kicking in and I just have to be strong because I can't be on the street and I know that would be worse. The guy I'm living with is a control freak, and has to have everything done his way and it's stressing me out. I can't even do my laundry alone in the basement for whatever reason, and that seemed odd to me. He yells at this friend of his and her kid most of the time. I asked him to buy me a pack of cigs and a gram of weed, and he said he would think about it, even though I have the funds to pay him back in 5 days. He eventually told me he would buy me a pack, but this is the last pack he's buying me (even though he has never bought me cigs before). The gram of weed was of course never going to happen. He does smoke me out (meth) while I'm waiting to buy a half oz in 5 days and I think he resents that, but I can't do anything about the fact that we came to an agreement that I would come here with no money and wait to get paid. He's just a very selfish and mean person, who probably wouldn't even care if I broke down crying. He told me over text before I came here that this would be my castle, what a fucking joke. I havent even been able to do my laundry yet or take a shower because I'm afraid he'll get upset that I'm bothering him. At this point I just hope he gets me high so I can feel numb, more numb than I already feel. I miss my mom, and I miss the love she gave me. I'm so alone here. My own post is making me cry and I don't want him to see that. The only positive aspect of this house is the 4K TV that I can zone out with when I'm high and pretend this isn't happening. I dont even have my kidney medication and I'm starting to doubt he's going to take me to the doctor on Monday like he said. Somebody please help me. I'm only 22 and I don't want to be a slave to this house, and I feel like I'm already shit out of luck because I have nowhere to go.

Girls for what? Short term sexual pleasure and ego boost? Its all fucking pointless. Knowledge? If having access to knowledge made us better people we would be in utopia right now. Wisdom?

485,t3_dkp9yj,What can I do to help my friend?,"A friend of mine I’ve had since I was 2 is in a very bad way mentally, she is very depressed and doesn’t leave the house anymore. She also turns her phone off for days on end so barely replies. She had a difficult upbringing and has had a bad time with bullying and I feel like she’s never been able to handle adult life. She won’t take any medication and also won’t see a therapist (even if it’s online) so it feels a bit frustrating sometimes as I don’t know how she will her better if she doesn’t accept medical help. 

I have always tried to be there for her as much as I can. I text her all the time and call her when I can see that her phone is on, I’ve also sent her letters and birthday presents. Sometimes she asks me to meet up with her and it’s very difficult, I lost my mum to suicide after she refused all help and find it extremely difficult being around my friend who acts the same way (my friend knows my mum died this way). I also have a heart condition which makes traveling quite stressful and draining (she lives over an hour away from me). 

She keeps asking me to meet up with her but as she won’t leave the house she wants me to go there, however for the reasons I explained above I find this very difficult. If I decline because of this she gets very upset and will ignore me for weeks, but if I say yes I know there’s a 50/50 chance I’ll have to cancel because of my health problems (she knows this) and if I do cancel she also then gets very upset and ignores me. The times when we do meet are very sad, she often only says 1 word answers and then we spend a lot of the time in silence. I don’t mind this because I know she is probably enjoying the company but it makes me feel quite emotional for a few days after. I am completely at a loss on what I can do to support her at this stage and it is really starting to bring me down and make me very depressed also.

489,t3_dkk5ak,How to manage without a therapist?,"So I have $40 in my account, clearly not enough to afford long-term therapy. Most psychology sessions I've been to have not been that helpful anyway, I essentially spent $100 to be taught breathing exercises that I already knew how to do. Tried medication for 6 months, made no difference.  I'm sure they work for some people, but their efficacy seems questionable when the most recent systematic review suggesting they are better than placebo, was funded by pharmaceutical companies.

Unfortunately, I don't even think I'm depressed despite testing very high on the DASS-21 and probably meeting criteria on the DSM. 

I'm pretty sure I'm just responding in a normal, analytical way to this horror show of life. I mean we've literally just been put on this planet without choice of our own and are expected to scrap something resembling a meaningful existence. I've spent 7 years selling my youth, studying intensively to just get an entry level job so that I can live a basic life in this meat grinder before dying. Contributing to this collapsing pyramid scheme that is life. I'm essentially filled with deep existential dread on a daily basis.

494,t3_dkoxa0,I can't think of a title. I just want to express my thoughts.,"I'm just not feeling the motivation to do anything with myself right now. I got diagnosed with depression about a week ago now and I can't tell if it helped me understand my feelings up to this point or not. 

I guess I've been depressed for a few years now, there wasn't really a specific catalyst, it was moreso just growing up and realising how hopeless and dark the world really is. I tried talking about how I felt at the time to my friends and family before. The most my family had to say was ""everyone gets sad sometimes."" And my friends only made me forget how I'd been feeling. I didn't really put it down to depression, I just thought I was stressed and that I'd get over it, but those days of apathy and sadness turned into weeks, then months, then years. I'd been terrified of going to a psychiatrist, social situations aren't my strong suit and I was afraid of being judged for my interests, but I didn't want to self-diagnose since that would be disrespectful. at the start of this year i'd had enough of my feelings. I thought that if I purely devoted my time solely to things that made me happy then maybe I'd get better, but that just it worse since I knew that I should have been productive with my time as I had responsibilities to attend to.

 Now I'm failing in almost every aspect of life, work, education, social interaction, my love-life. I just don't see the point anymore. I'm afraid of just dying as a nobody but on the other hand I don't see the point of living on either. So that's why I got a diagnosis I needed an answer to my sadness, but now it feels like more of an excuse to continue failing with life. I don't feel like I can do anything anymore, I feel weak and pathetic, I hate my body, My personality is awful, I can't see any good in the World anymore. So I just try to fake a smile and go on with my day. I'll probably never tell anyone about my depression, I don't want pity because I don't deserve it. I've brought everything on myself by not realising my situation sooner. I'm gonna try and see a therapist and hopefully that's gonna help but I'm not sure if it will.

498,t3_dkll38,"I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I could snap at any second. The pain the is overwhelming."," 

 I was never interested in boys as a  teenage girl, I always was an  introvert, and spent my time either  studying, reading, playing vidya, or  painting. Did not really have any  close friends, but I was generally  content with my life. My  relationship with my father was not so great,  he was often cold and  emotionally distant, would get angry at the  smallest of things and  start yelling at everyone. His attitude towards  every other person was  often coarse and condescending, my father also  believed that the most  important attribute a girl can bear is her purity  (i.e her virginity),  in our household, i was shown that being feminine  was a sign of vanity  and correlated with being empty-headed. I think,  the stereotype that  women are attracted to men who are similar to their  fathers is quite  true.

I was perfectly fine going  with my father was the  right thing to do, until when I was around 19/20  years old biology  kicked in and I started to show interest in the  opposite sex all of a  sudden, at that point I still had not . I did try  to suppress these  urges as I thought they were wrong and will hinder  me, but the  loneliness soon overcame me and I could fight them anymore.  There was  this one person with whom I had a couple of shared interests  and went to  school with. I started to develop feelings for this person  and  fantasized about being with them, I still had some internal  struggles  about these feelings of mine but eventually told the person  about how I  feel. At this point, mind you, I still had not grew out of  my tomboyish  phase, did not have any sex appeal (still don't in my  mid-twenties)  while I watched all of my female peers turn into fine  ladies, and I had  fallen into deep depression. This person said he did  not feel the same  way towards me, I stayed friends with this person but  then cut him off  after a lot of mental struggle, he was my only friend  at that time but  seemed to want to take advantage of me because of how  i felt towards  him.

I used to go  on 4chan a lot before that, but I started going to r9k  (a board that  is somewhat similar to the incels subreddit). I was able  to relate to  these lonely men and felt a great deal of sympathy towards  them. The  melancholy was quite addicting, and the women- hate they all  displayed  never bothered me, as I did bear hatred towards other women at  that  time mainly because all of the other women had something that I  was  missing: sex appeal and femininity. I ended up meeting a man from  there  online, now this guy was the sweetest person I had ever met, he   treated me so kindly and showed a lot of interest in me, I'd never been   treated like this before and being starved of affection I fell deeply  in  love with this person. We had a lot in common, similar struggles and   similar interests. I became obsessed with this person, always thinking   of him, looking at his photograph for hours and wanting to embrace and   save him, I became extremely attached to him, in an unhealthy manner.   Soon after this person started to change his attitude with me, took a   complete 180 degrees turn and started being aggressive, hateful, and   verbally abusive, even though he treated other females normally, and was  especially nicer to the ones who were good looking and who he thought  would have sex with him. I found out this person had bipolar disorder  and his  mood swings happened very frequently that they can switch  within hours.  He also did not have the best childhood and was rejected  by women a lot.  I tried to cut him off but I wasn't able to because I  felt a great  amount of love towards him and did not want to abandon  him. A few years  pass, we still had not met in real life, but I would  always try to help  him, cheer him up, and do anything in my power to  make him feel better.  But he never appreciated me bending over  backwards for him or any of  things i did for him and continued to act  so aggressive with me. My  reasoning behind not cutting him off, is my  great attachment to him and  me seeing myself in him in someway.

Naturally,  this took a huge toll on  my mental well being and caused me a set of  issues that i had never had  before, I suffered a lot but I still was  not able leave him. The hatred  was contagious and now I feel jaded  towards everyone, and especially  these men that I used to sympathize  with, I feel like my soul has been  sucked out of me and I am nothing  but a husk. The attachment won't go  away, because i am weak and alone. I  learned my lesson, the cost was  very big, and I no longer want to be  with a man, I am somewhat okay with  being on my own, but I still can't  let go of this person. Wherever I  go, topics of sex and relationships  are being shoved in my face and It  gets me into intense anger and  sadness, seeing other women with their  partners makes me feel  inadequate and envious. How do I leave this  person forever without  being overcome with guilt and loneliness",depression

500,t3_dkiud1,Shouldn't family be helpful and supportive? Then why do I feel horrible when I'm around them?,"I have something called depersonalization disorder. It's when you suffer from episodes where you feel like you're out of your body, with everything else getting distorted and your body feeling like it's shrinking, and you're basically standing there unable to move. It's an extremely uncomfortable feeling, it's like your consciousness leaving your body. I also seem to get pseudohallucinations, as if dpd wasn't enough. 

According to my therapist, the reason is most likely immense stress and childhood trauma. I was highly introverted since I was a kid, plus being aromantic asexual didn't help. Because of my mother's disgust (beatings were involved) and how children used to bully me, I learned to act ""normal"". For years I lied about what I like, what I hate, my personality was a performance and it worked, I made tonnes of friends, and my mother got nicer. Apparently my obsession with being accepted was stressful, and I started getting episodes when I was around 15. 

I was away from my family for years. I got treatment, I started hearing far less voices and episodes started to lessen. I came home recently, was very excited to see my sister who I consider or considered to be the only family I have. She comes in and tells me how I have zero problems and I'm exaggerating. I tried to explain and she laughed and said that I watch too many movies. My cousins, uncle, mother, everyone seems to have the same opinion.

it’s so hard to do anything. it’s like i want to be a functional human being but i’ve forgotten how. my brain is all over the place!!!!! god i hate myself 

one year ago this time i was at my absolute worst. i didn’t think i’d survive the winter, literally. told my mom i was suicidal, she told me i was making excuses. told her again, she said there just wasn’t time for me to worry about fixing my mental health when i should be focusing on fixing my grades (why do you think i’m failing in the first place? what will my grades matter if i’m dead or as good as dead?) 

ive lived online for a long time, i guess it’s a coping mechanism. my family always ignored me so i pretty much raised myself online. i’ve had a few anonymous online accounts, twitter mainly, where i’d talk about my interest in fashion, made some acquaintances that i could talk to and vent about my mental health/ED. it’s cool, but it’s a distraction from real life which maybe isn’t totally healthy

515,t3_dk9cca,"Don’t open up to your friends. Better yet, don’t have friends!"," I’ve tried the friend thing. Isolating is terrible for depression, or so they say. Yeah. So is watching everyone slowly resent you and torturing your family/friends. 

Here’s my cycle: 

It’s a cycle that isn’t even the fault of any friend. I keep putting on the facade of okay or happy or whatever. Eventually, cracks start to show, or I open up about a bad period, or whatever. IDK. Everyone damn near begs me to open up, convinced that it’ll help, that they can help, and at first I hold out because I know that’s bullshit. But eventually, I start to believe them. Which is somewhat understandable. They believe them. They genuinely want to help me. 

But when they realize that it’s not that simple, that this isn’t so temporary, they start to feel trapped in the friendship or something. Resentment. whatever. I try really hard not to be one of those overbearing mentally ill people. Even though it’s fucking hard. I tell people to please be fucking candid with me if I’m being too much. I’ve ended friendships because it was obvious to me that I was burdening them with my sadness, or just drifted away because I didn’t have the energy to keep up the facade, only for them to tell me it’s okay, it’s fine, they miss me, because they feel some kind of obligation now? I don’t know. I don’t want fucking pity friendships. 

It’s kinda funny. In the end it’s either ghosting or a fight in which they pat themselves on the back for sticking around for so long. Where they talk about how hard it was for them to see you so miserable and to try to help.

I try to look at it from their perspective. And it just makes me feel sad because it’s like I’m not even a fucking person anymore. I’m just a miserable shell that drains the energy from everyone I’m around. I’m a fucking burden, and these friends will swear up and down that I’m not because they read that that’s what they’re supposed to say, all the while dreading my presence until they just can’t take it anymore. 

It’s also funny because of how much I fucking censor it. I very purposefully set boundaries. Half the time opening up isn’t even venting, it’s just not acting happy, or pretending like I’m not completely exhausted. but no one wants to be around someone who seems half dead. 

It’s fucking sad. Because at the same time, they’re so well-intentioned, typically. They don’t want to leave. They want you back, but you when you were happy, or more likely, you before they knew you were depressed. Eventually, they give up, when they realize that it’s too hard, that you’re not getting better or you’re not getting better enough. I think about it from their perspective and it’s completely understandable. But it’s funny too. It’s fucking hilarious that these friends give all this advice and expect it to be that easy to get better, to get out of your head, while witnessing what the fuck depression, mental illness, whatever, does.

I read so many posts about people trying their best to support mentally ill friends or family members filled with comments about how it’s a burden, you have to take time for yourself, you can’t expect much, if it's too much just leave, you can't fix anyone, yadda yadda, sometimes it’s worth it but also lol, and I just feel so fucking defeated. I can’t have friends. I can’t have friends until I’m better but I don’t know what the fuck better is and this isolation is making it worse, right? I can't have friends without feeling guilty about my illness making them feel bad. 

I think it would all be so much better if I just kept up the facade so when I blow my brains out my old friends will have the consolation of surprise. That they didn’t know how bad it was, and if I just told them, they could have helped. 

If it’s this fucking hard for you to see me in my head like this, how hard do you think it is to live here?

I could make friends if I could keep up the facade. I could keep the friends I kinda have and am drifting apart from if I would put the facade back on. I could reconcile friendships. All I would have to do is act like I’m better. But I can’t anymore. I understand that I’m a hard person to love. Depression makes me a shitty friend. But what the fuck am I supposed to do besides isolate? Yeah, I push people away before they can get tired of me, no shit. As if I need more people confirming what my depression is screaming at me all the time. No one wants you around. 

I wish I could be worried about my personality ruining friendships. I wish I could see what habits will build resentments. I don’t even have a chance to destroy my own fucking life. Or maybe my personality is just depression now. That’s what my friends seemed to think. Me too.",depression

Two depressed people together? Hard and I knew we’d remain stuck together so i didn’t wanna be with him even more. I grew the courage in 2018. 

I had never been single and I thought I’d fix my depression losing weight. Wrong. I thought I’d fix it with dating and stepping out of my box. Wrong. I met R. All I did was get into the most toxic relationship with a narcissist where I developed really bad anxiety. Where I also found out he was cheating and instead of answering my hurt questions, he forced himself on me while I sobbed, couldn’t breathe, broken. I felt like nothing on my own. Now the guy I thought I loved just treated me like I’m nothing. Nothing at all. My anxiety was bad. I was depressed. I’d open my eyes in the middle of the night  and I felt sadness. I’d cry, change positions and go back to sleep. I was tired. Exhausted. I just wanted to open my eyes a feel okay. I just added to my damage. I use to be next to R and be thinking “ I could kill myself and I don’t think he’d care. “
I broke that off this summer. 

Now fall 2019. I’m single. Depressed with added baggage. I don’t talk to R and I doubt he’ll ever be in my life again. I talk to A though and I have a feeling he’ll always have a place in my life. We are strictly friends and It’s a blessing how we really just talk. I know he’s talking to other girls and it doesn’t bother me. I advice him. I want him to be happy. I want him to meet his forever. But he’s more depressed than me or we just cope  differently. If I’m sad, I do everything possible to stay away from sad songs, movies, stories because it makes my hole feel deeper. But A loooooveess to feed into his sadness with more sad things. Also I can’t vent to him because I know he’ll carry my pain. 

So pretty much now sometimes it’s difficult to talk to A because he wants to talk about depressing shit and I can’t. I can’t. I can’t...... venting, 2 depressed people talking like just hurts my soul. I can’t do it. As soon as I sense the conversation changing I begin to become fearful of what he can say that might trigger me. I can’t handle it. I can barely handle my own pain. Barely. 

I wish I could be there for him in that way but I try to keep our conversations casual, deep but never about emotions. 

I pray life gifts him everything he deserves.  I’ll be in his life the best way I can.

He’s not alone. I’m not alone. You are not alone.",depression

521,t3_dknyhg,Thanksgiving disaster,"My family and I decided to postpone Thanksgiving this year, so that we could all eat together as a family. I told my parents that I would like to do it, so that they could kick back and relax. They agreed. Skip forward to today, and I wake up at 10 am to start cooking the food...only to find out that the food has already been cooked by my parents. I was immediately frustrated, I felt a bit betrayed. I know how to do this stuff, yet, they seemingly don't trust me with it. I held my tongue, started making the pumpkin pie. Yet, 5 minutes into it's baking time, the crust burns. I lost it. I know I shouldn't have and I know that it's literally a crust, but I couldn't stand it.   


It reminds me of all the things I'm trying to accomplish as a person. I feel like I'm trying so hard but everything fucks up. I feel like my parents knew that I'd fuck up the dinner too and decided to do it themselves. I get this feeling every once in awhile that I can actually make it in life and the thing that obliterates that feeling is the many ways I can screw up in life. I have no job, despite applying for so many, I have little to no friends, I have no future, I have nothing to look forward to and like a rubber stamp of a sterotype, I'm the basement dweller, the one thing everyone enjoys laughing at. No matter how much I try to enjoy life, something screws up to make that impossible.",depression

I know this isn’t true for everyone but goddamn it I’ve been getting a little better lately so I’m putting more effort into sleeping better, and guess what now I’m more fucking depressed. Absolutely wonderful. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. What a fun thing our brains invented!",depression
523,t3_dknvy9,So it started nearly 15 years ago...,"I love drawing. When I was younger I would draw all the time, and my mom would show my work to people. That wasn’t the bad part. But, one time she showed my work to some artist who had a gallery. I had a drawing of a dragon in goth clothing. And she laughed at it. “Dragons are not goth. Don’t draw that again.” Then my mom laughs along with her, “ haha, yeah. Who does that.” 
Now...that drawing had actually been my favorite drawing. I was super proud of it. To hear my mom laugh at it, hurt.
So...over the next few years I slowly drew less and less. And stopped showing my parents my work. Now I just doodle here and there. I’ve found other ways to be creative, but....that incident changed me. I’m no longer confident in anything I do.
My depression is soo severe now, that I don’t even feel like doing anything creative anymore. Which makes me feel more depressed.
I’m trying though, to get back to being creative. It’s just....so hard. I have a sketchbook book that Ive been staring at for the last few months. Only a few doodles.
I have been seeing a therapist for 6 months now. Hopefully seeing her is helping.

I could never be that brave and virtuous myself. I feel like everyone around me is so moral and cares deeply about these issues, but I myself feel so detached from them, like they've never been relevant to my own life. I decided I wasn't good enough for someone I had romantic interests in, because I got to know her well enough to realize that she wants someone strong and brave. I feel like I was born just to witness how other people are so much better than I am. More kind, more moral, more fun to be around, better looking, more lovable. I just want to sleep and relax all day and take care of myself, and everything about this world says that all of that makes me a bad person. I wish the world would just end me already if I'm so awful. I am not sad about these feelings anymore.

I'm not jealous of their experiences, I'm jealous of their strengths and the fact that people care about them.

Since being here I broke up with my gf because we both agreed it wouldn't work long distance. I feel like that was really the only thing keeping my head above water, and it's too late to get her back because she doesn't wanna get back together. 

The self-hatred didn't just start when we broke up, it's been a present almost my entire childhood and teenage years. It's taken me a while to realise but it actually prevents me from doing day to day tasks, i often don't leave my room out of fear of being judged, I've stopped going to the gym because I feel like i look pathetic or that everyone will stare/laugh at me. 

All of this pushes me to take a sort of self defeating attitude all the time, which i think rubs off on other people. I will basically make fun of myself so much that other people will just join in cause they think im fine with it, which ofc i reassure them that i am, but realistically it makes me feel like shit. I really have made an active effort to stop myself thinking in this way, but it never works and my worst fear is that it gets so bad that i drop out of uni and have to go back home with no plan, no friends and the same sense or worthlessness i had when i left.",depression

I have always felt alienated from friends and family although I have lots. I've always been the therapist friend and had to deal with other peoples shit for hours on end. It came to the point where I just ended up blocking my friends because i couldn't handle all the pressure anymore.

I often contemplate suicide and ended up writing a note last month on the 19th.  I was going to jump off a water tower the next day. I went to multiple friends and got help from one but everyone else just shrugged it off saying stuff like ""don't be stupid"". This tears me apart because no one ever gives back to me after I have put so much time and effort into helping them. I get shit on wile everyone else keeps moving without helping. At this point I lost all faith in God and found life meaningless.  

I feel like no one understands me, they all think of life in such a linear way and I can't reach out to anyone when I say there is no point to life. They might think they get it but if they truly did they would be thinking how I do. 

I think that after death is the same as before you were born, a void of nothingness so whats there to be scared of. We live in a society where we're told whats right and wrong when there is absolutely no point to anything. There are no good and bad guys but just people who exist for no reason. Everyone and everything you love will one day die. There is no point to go on but i don't want to die right now.  I'm okay with death if it confronts because I know that I'll eventually die on day. I see no wrong with chaos because nothing you do matters. I'm always sad but I can temporarily experience happiness through laughter and being with certain people but I just go back to being sad.

I feel alone not from the fact that I'm misunderstood. I like to believe that I'm mature for my age and that I think very logically. No one my age that i have talked to can really comprehend what I'm saying. I have an IQ of 131 but I don't bother to do anything besides smoke weed or drink. I started being extra nice to people so I can feel like I'm making a difference but I know that I'm not. I want to be remembered when I did but I know that is not possible. I became very pessimistic after I stopped believing in god because I know that Optimism just sets you up for failure.

I despise myself, my looks, my character, I'm always questioning everything about my thinking and behavior.

542,t3_dkn97h,I am having a very difficult time with one of my DBT groups.,"I am doing DBT. The program is done in groups, and there are four groups in total. I am taking two of them, and when I finish I will be taking two more. They are divided into different topics. There are different people in both of my weekly groups, but they are run by the same people and follow the same format.

When I go to group I am given a workbook that contains everything we will cover, as well as the details. The facilitators also follow this booklet when they host the group, so I can read through the whole booklet and know exactly what we are covering that day. We then go through it and they give more specific examples, run scenarios, and answer questions.

In my first group, things run smoothly. We finish on time, and all group input is on topic and helpful to everyone.

My second group is not so smooth. The facilitators do not moderate the group very well. There are two members of the group that turn it into a massive validation circle jerk and we don't even get to finish the topic for the day because they waste so much time. Other people don't get to speak, and the group isn't able to cover everything scheduled, so it is directly impacting everyone's experience.

Facilitator: so to reduce stress you can use this breathing exercise-

Member: Oh I breathed once. It was great, helped a lot. I used to not breathe and I would then get dizzy, but I had a dinner with family that was stressful and I read on Facebook that breathing helps, so I tried breathing and it helped. I am kind of an expert on breathing now. This one time I forgot to breathe and I passed out and had to go to the hospital. The doctor told me I need to breathe. See? Even doctors recommend breathing. I read that some people have therapy dogs who help them remember to breathe by licking their hands. I know someone who trains dogs, but I am just training my chihuahua how to do it. He breathes really good, you can tell because he barks loud. He can't lick my hand so I trained him to lick my ankle instead. He can't be certified because he is too hyper, but I can breathe on my own for short periods of time so it is ok. I once -

SHUT UP! OH MY GOD!

This is NOT a therapy group, this is a self help workshop. Get a therapist, or some friends, or a journal. Don't waste everyone's time!

It is to the point I want to drop out of the group, but I was on a wait list for two years and don't want to have to wait again. Last time I tried to talk to the facilitators after group, but the circlejerkers immediately run up to them to talk more so I never get the chance to say anything.

I am sooooo frustrated. So far the only thing I get out of it is some practice using the advanced stress management skills I am taught in my other group.

I always thought that having friends from different backgrounds and friends who think differently from myself would be the most interesting and beneficial for everyone involved. They always seem to find someone they like better, though. I end up as the “odd man out” every. single. time. Even when I was little. 

Things like this really mess with your self-esteem and self-perception when you’re young. I started to explore myself, picking apart my flaws, looking for why they don’t like me enough to treat me like a priority. This turned into a lot of anxiety and aversion to people when I got older. 

Now I have some friends since I am in college, but I am constantly overthinking and wondering if they have hidden agendas or they just use me. I can’t help but think this about everyone I get close to. And oftentimes I think that may be what runs them off.

I don't remember how it started but soon I was trapped in my bed crying. My pillow was soaked. Whenever I thought about doing anything (like asking a friend for help or brushing my teeth), there was such a torrent of negative thoughts and I would start crying again. I was so violently sad and scared I would be stuck for the rest of the day, maybe the week. I was so focused on not crying that I was stuck laying there. After a length of time (I lost track), I pulled myself together enough to watch a movie. I felt so agitated after what happened to me. I couldn't enjoy the movie, I was so uncomfortable and sad that I couldn't stand just laying down and watching the movie. Then, after the agitation, I felt drained. It was miserable, but I was able to finally talk to someone and feel a bit better.

I feel so crushed and need to vent.","So when I first met this girl, we clicked right off the bat. We were in a LDR but I feel like because of that fact I arguably loved her more. I’ve seen her a few times in the span of the time we got together and it was magical, I felt like nothing could stop us at that time. 

We had some arguments about things but nothing too serious. In my opinion the straw that broke the camels back was the fact we were both under the impression we never done anything prior with anyone else. Well she went to the OBGYN and turns out she had contracted HPV. From that point on it was non stop argument about things. I wanted to try to move past it because I knew deep down I’ve never done anything but I felt a resentment brewing on her behalf as time progressed. 

On Sunday, she told me she wanted to take a break but still loved me. Then after 4 hours she texted me back because she still loved me and that made me feel so good because of how much I missed her. She told me under the condition there wasn’t any drama moving forward. I agreed and was happy my love took me back. Proceeding to yesterday I made a stupid comment to her about something me and my friends were talking about in a game and that pushed her over the edge. I’ve been thinking nonstop about how I couldn’t have just sent the text and it would have been okay. 

Last night she blocked me on all platforms, ended off saying she doesn’t love me any more over a petty argument we got into. Their parents and sister interpreted it as something it wasn’t. I genuinely am sad how things panned out. 

We always talked about our future together and how much she loved me and I feel like all that was thrown away over a stupid comment I made.  Me and my friends were playing a game and saw a pornstar picture on the other team and we were making comments on it. I just chimes in because I didn’t want to be left out. My girlfriend interpreted it as cheating because we met online and she didn’t know weather or not I was talking to other people which was kind of confusing. 

I feel like shit, she was the only person I felt like I could open up to without feeling judged or anything of that nature. I told her I loved her still and she hung up on me. I hope that she can take me back because no one is perfect.

552,t3_dkn096,What can I do?,"A few days ago I was on the phone with my friend. We were on a long rant about just how my mind works, he likes to try to help me figure things out. Though we tend to go in circles. 

Anyways, I never really thought about it in depth before but we uncovered that I was sexually assaulted at least 3 times. 

There were three times, that I can remember, well sort of remember (my memory is shit). 

We were wondering if this could be the cause of my issues with sex. My breakdowns during and after. But I still do not think so it does not feel like it is the cause. Mainly because even after I found out that these things that happened to me were sexual assault I still did not have any feelings toward these events. I am not upset about them, they do not hurt me, they do not instill any emotion besides a bit of anger because the fact that those people would do that to me. But at the time that these things happened I just let it.   
I basically just went with it, blank mind and all. I just didnt care. But these things were years ago, like 5 plus years. 

Why is it that I just do not care about things that most people would probably find difficult? 

Could this be a reason some how for my breakdowns during and after sex? Even though I have never had these memories in my mind during those breakdowns? 

I honestly really do not feel like it is but my bf wants to think that it is. But I think he just wants some answer. When honestly I think it might just be that I just feel like a sack, a play toy. I have no connection to sex being a good thing. I always used it as a way to get people to like me. I felt... well still feel like if I do not give them sex early on that the whole relationship is just built around that. The way they act, speak, their mannerisms are all conformed around the want to have sex with this person (me). So I just have the mind set that if I just give it to them I will find out if they actually like me for me and not just hanging around to get sex. I do not think that I will ever think differently. I have thought this way for over 10 years. 

Sigh my mind is just a hectic place that is just getting more frayed.",depression

have been suffering from depression for about 12 years. Sometimes it’s not so bad, sometimes it is.

I’m no expert but it’s all about training your mind to deal with your thoughts. I’m not saying it’s going to work for you but I would strongly encourage anyone interested in controlling harmful thoughts to give it a try. 

Download an app called headspace. I’m not advertising it, I’m just saying it’s helped me and I think it can help other people too. It’s a guided meditation app. It guides you through the basics of concept called mindfulness meditation. There is a wealth of scientific literature that supports the use of mindfulness meditation as a means to help those with mental health issues. The first 10 lessons are free, after that you need to pay. I’ve just used the free lessons so far and I feel they have made an impact already. If you want to learn anything further from that you can probably get it from YouTube without having to pay money for it on the app.

Also, a book called mindfulness by an author called Tessa Watt. It’s enthralling and you’ll get through it easily in a night. You can buy it off amazon for about $6.

And falling deeper and deeper into this void where nothing good ever happens. It's dark and filled with demons you thought you had buried a long time ago. But they are there to collectively remind you of what a piece of humanoid trash you are. It's an echo chamber of your worst thoughts, getting louder and louder. You try to scream but your voice gets drowned by your own insecurities. 
Funny thing is, it's dark down there, but when you look up, you see how everything is moving on, everyone is going about their day like a normal person. Yet you're down there in the dark trying desperately to climb back up, trying to catch up with everyone else. 
But you just keep falling. And falling over and over. 
Then you start wonder what's the point of even trying? 
No matter how hard you try, the bottom keeps getting bigger. And even if you did make it back to the surface, you know the world would have passed by you. No one will ever care that you hit rock bottom and that you crawled your way up. No one's giving you a medal, a cookie or a even a slight acknowledgement of how hard it's been for you. 
Eventually you start to wonder what's the difference? 
Up here, down there, it's all the same. Nobody cares either ways.

Compared to where I was two months ago Im doing amazing, Im just wondering if there is ever a point where through ""healthy"" thinking/living that you feel ""good"" (instead of just ""ok"").

585,t3_dkgdqi,A losers manifesto.,"Something that ive come to notice over the years that i have wasted my youth approaching that period of no return (30 in 6 years) ive stopped to take a look around mentally. And in doing so, ive found one strong truth that no amount of moping or depression will try to make an excuse for:

I'm a loser, plain n simple.

I mean honestly, im 24 years old, i dont have a clue what im supposed to do or what im even supposed to love for, while on the other side people are living outside of their mothers basement with the beginnings of a career, a college degree, lots of friends, hell some have been on their own and are self reliant and self sustaining. They take care of themselves and theyre outgoing and not afraid to take risks but also are self disciplined to not go wild.

Me on the other hand?

My last job only lasted 3 months. It was as a telemarketer. The longest ive ever held a job is 7 months at a warehouse,and between those two jobs i was unemployed and broke for 8 months. I only have what, 18 credit hours to my name and i couldnt finish because i was too stubborn to sit down and grind it for the long haul or actually find what im good at or a career i actually want. Any time a person tries to talk to me i just shut them out out of self pity, which is why im down to like 4 friends who i dont fuckong trust anyway. 

Family ties? What family ties. I have none. The last time my brother tried to invite me to go see him i shut him out because i was too damn depressed and am too fucking proud to talk to my own fucking brother when i know he'll listen to me and would want nothing more but to talk to me. Same probably goes with the rest of my fucking family too but im too convinced and set in my ways that they hate me for being a fucking failure. 

And money? Please. I owe $975 to a collection, which already remessed up my credit score after having to turn to my mother to bail me out of a charge off. And i dont have a job because i dont have the god damn balls to enter the job market because i dont have a car and because its starting to get cold. 

Im a weakling, a wuss, a loser, a ship without a captain.

I honestly wonder how i can even know what love is if im so weak, forget finding a SO. nobody wants a loser with a weak mentality and is as fragile as a glass house with no drive or ambition or idea what i want to do in my life.

Im an FA because im just a loser. No self improvement on the externals can fix whats wrong in my head. I realize that now. But im too fargone, and honestly, i think its too late for me anyway.

How is it so hard to be normal?

To willingly do things without battling the negative thoughts in your head? I have to get ready, take a shower, look and act like a human. All while putting on a face and pretending that you're ok. Because nobody really wants to hear that you're not doing well and you need help.

My interests and hobbies are long gone. My days are spent at work with a mask that's so fake, I sometimes believe my own lie about how I feel and present myself to the world. At home, I spend hours lying in bed or on the couch, procrastinating the simplest task, such as hygiene, cleaning and just leaving the house.

Trying to be normal is something that I've given up on for the simple fact that I don't know how to be normal. I don't know how to stop my negative thoughts, my intrusive thoughts, the thoughts that everyone hates me, is better off without me. 

I don't have friends, I have family who of course look out for eachother, but I am always left behind or left out, or at least in my mind I am. I have an amazing and wonderful boyfriend who knows my demons are trying to win and does everything in his power to help me, but I feel like all I'm doing is dragging him down with me and he could do a lot better.

The anxiety and depression of life in general, from trivial to massive seems to be piling on. And it's exhausting. My brain never. Stops. Going.

594,t3_dkfh0y,Tired of the game of life.,"I’m not asking for pities. I just want to know if anyone feels the same.

*Sigh* Maybe it’s one of those days, but I really don’t believe in living. 

Goals, I do have. Plans, I do have. But why do I even have these plans and goals when, in the end, I’m gonna die anyways? I guess I’m more of a destination person than a journey. 

That’s not all. I work hard and try to see the lights at the end of the tunnel, but the only tunnel I’m looking forward to is the exit of life. I feel like I’m playing a game along with seven billion other people. Winning or losing don’t matter, because I only care about whether there’s an ending to this game. Will it end after death? Man, I just don’t want to play the game. 

Maybe my mind is fucked, and that’s why it’s called an “illness” or whatever. It ticks me off knowing that we’re just living things, everyday trying to control our life the “right” way because people said so. Who said our whole life has been the truth? What if it has been altered this whole time and we’re just playing the game of lies. As you’re reading this right now, don’t you question your existence sometimes? 

I’m more interested in what life has after death. Is there a different path or merely nothingness? I don’t care. I’m wasting my breath and energy living a life that requires breath and energy. These laws, regulations, rules, precedents—I want to escape them all. Maybe I should have been born in the 16th century or something where humans were less informed and technologies were less advanced. Meh, I probably would still questioned life either ways. 
I feel like we’re just mere puppets who believe we have the control over our actions during the short duration of time we get to live. 

I guess it is just one of those nights.",depression

I don’t need to tell you guys how I feel, you already know. Empty, tired, down. Depressed. Not all the time. But a good amount recently. My job is hourly, menial, and repetitive. But it pays for everything I need and it has some perks. It’s pretty no stress besides the dumb stuff I make into a problem and worry about. 

But then I think about how easy my life is, how privileged I am. How many people love me, how fortunate I am to not be disabled, to live where I do, to have a job, an education, a “well off” family who could catch me if I needed them to. A million other things that other people don’t have that I do. People would kill to have the support system I do. Have insurance, a therapist, medication.

And that makes me feel worse. Pitiful. Pathetic. People lost their parents or siblings when they were young, houses burned down, poverty, cancer, dead children, whatever. I’m just a spoiled brat drug addict (sober in recovery) who takes and takes but never gets enough in life even tho they have plenty.

599,t3_dkffvt,I talked to a girl today.,"I’m a 19(M) and I have EXTREMELY LOW self esteem and depression issues.  I don’t see myself as anything worth paying attention to, especially the opposite sex.  A little background before I get into this, I have a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I’m working on as an off road project and its one of the only things that makes me happy.  I was at the auto parts store earlier today and I saw another Jeep like mine so I parked next to it.  I went inside and got the part I needed and I started working on it when a girl walked outside and started getting into the Jeep next to mine.  I instinctively called out “nice Jeep”, and she said the same to me.  Once two Jeep owners get talking about jeeps, it’s hard to find a place to stop.  We talked about the issues we’ve had in the past with them and future plans for upgrades.  I was really nervous that I would say something weird or out of line that would make her feel weirded out or something because I can count on one hand the number of times that I’ve had a full conversation with a girl my age.  We were about to head our separately ways when she asked if I had Snapchat.  I was blown away that another human being was asking for my contact information and not the other way around like usual.  We swapped info and she headed out.  My mind is racing and I got in my car and started crying.  All of these emotions that had been buried away for years just came out like a dam bursting open.  There was a small sliver of hope that told me that I might actually not be a worthless piece of shit but it was snuffed out just as quickly as it came.  Thank you if you read all of this.",depression

I was born with an autoimmune disease that slowly crippled  (hate that word, but lacking a better one) my body right from the start,  and then I had an accident at a young age and I've been a wheelchair  user since. So much of life was ripped away from me. So many experiences  I'll never get to have. So many things perfectly able-bodied people  take for granted, and I can't stand it.

The  real icing on the cake is that I have no choice but to depend on others  for help with the majority of things I need, and they treat me like a  burden all at the same time. I don't understand it. I know that it's  hard to look after anyone who's sick, but is it really that hard to  empathize and care? To understand? I didn't ask for any of this to  happen, but it'd be really nice to have a support system full of people  who genuinely do give a damn and want the best for me.

And  the thing that impacts me most is my dating life. So many people claim  to be accepting and treat everyone equal, but if I tell them about my  disability, there's a big change. Suddenly it's not worth it, I'm not  worth making a priority or being with. I'm not good enough. Having a  good heart is pointless if your legs don't work, apparently.

I'm  so sick of it all. I just want to live a better life. I want to be full  of life and love, be surrounded by people who care about me and  actually mean it and aren't shy of showing it.

No anger, joy, excitement. The usual. Just a painful nothingness, except even a slight form of disappointment from my partner (only them) could send me on a downward spiral that lasted several days. I would feel violated by their touch and become suicidal.

I'm 33 and was afraid to be on drugs my entire life, but I decided I'd give them a shot or kill myself if they didn't work.

I started wellbutrin and have been better. I no longer have downward spirals that last several days. And I no longer have the painful numbness. But I still feel no good feelings. 

My psychiatrist said that the meds can't MAKE me happy, just set me at a baseline. I have to do that on my own. But I've done everything. Traveled, taken up new hobbies, exercised daily, got a new high paying job, made friends. 

I have everything I could ask for, but I still feel no good feelings. I feel no really bad feelings either, except sometimes the standard depression that'll last a couple of hours. But I never do the weird things I've used to do (things I look back on and find it hard to believe that was me). 

The best I can seem to hope for is distraction.

But alas i didnt, my depression spiked and i panicked so bad on the way to work i threw up and than i had my medication changed, been on it for 4 weeks now and still not quite used to it. My insomnia has come back worse than ever that for 4 nights i didnt sleep. I have never gone that long without any sleep what so ever so now on sleeping tablets that double as anti depressants.

Yet i am still feeling so down in the dumps. I cut for the first time in close to a year and i couldnt stop, i didnt do it bad but i still did it. Than my partner went away for a few weeks overseas and he kissed a girl whilst he was away. 

I know it isnt that bad but ive been cheated on before and i have been in such a dark place lately and he knows how dark my mind has been but still did that. And since he has been back he has been distant and doesnt seem to care to make amends. He looks at me differently as if he isnt attracted to me anymore and as if he realised after that kiss that he doesnt want me. 

A few days ago i actually thought of planning my suicide. I have had thoughts of suicide alot but never actually thought of planning it. Im worried about myself. I am losing control, all i think about is cutting myself or how i will kill myself and i cry myself to sleep every night. I dont know what to do anymore... i just want to end it.

618,t3_dkeczj,I lost one of the closest friends I've had and it's my fault.,"Hey all, just need a place to put this and vent since I've exhausted the other people in life with my whinging.

I met a person online a couple of years ago in a game and we hit it off very well. Our relationship became very close very quickly, but it felt natural. Like I found my other half behind the screen. I had few friends at the time and I've always struggled with growing close to people, but I never felt stressed around them.

Then ugly anxiety started to rear it's head around the corner. They struggled greatly with depression, and myself to a lesser degree- it made it easier to cope with each other's shortcomings. Though in time, I'd grow to be exceptionally clingy and needy.. I needed validation from this person, because I couldn't give it to myself. I got jealous seeing them doing stuff with others, etc. It wasn't ever intended to be malicious, but I'd not talk about my feelings or issues in honesty and hid them instead, until I lashed out. We were both guilty of this, truthfully, but I grew progressively nastier as the other things in my life begun to weigh down upon me. Not an excuse, still.

We ended up having a bit of a fight sometime this year and things weren't really the same after that. I honestly believed I was trying to be a better and more open person, giving them space and not isolating them- but they said I became worse. Insulting. Abusive. Malicious. I was confused. Eventually it drew to the point where, I felt that they were better off without me, so I removed them from my messaging application. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And perhaps, not the wisest.

I tried reconnecting with them with an apology letter. It didn't go well, as I should've guesssed. I know I can't fix things, and I've hurt them more than I helped them. I feel like an awful piece of shit. I can't help but think on the things I could've done to avoid this. But it's too late now. I guess I just need somewhere to place this.

Off drugs since 3.5 years, suffered numerous hellish issues ,but also lost my feelings of humbleness and respect for elders. I have also  spiritual faith I earlier have.

I put my school on hold, I thought we had a plan. 

Now my life is turned completely on it’s head. I’m alone. I was managing two jobs to maintain all of the bills until he figured his stuff out and now I have to continue to do that... alone.

To make it all worse, I was sexually harassed by some strange delivery man who tried to kiss me... I had to make complaints in regards to him to the delivery service and to my apartment community.

I ask this because I've just been introduced and so far have had 2 with massively positive experiences. I apologize if this breaks any rules.

I'll make this as short as I can but I've suffered with Social Anxiety for 10 years and heavy depression for around 6 or 7 years. Over time, things have gotten worse to the point where this year especially, I've noticed I have NO excitement, no care for anything. I stopped dreaming, chasing goals..I swear if I won 10 million, I wouldn't blink an eye. Things have been really bad basically. I've wanted to give up a few times.

2 nights ago I had my first gummie and it wasn't so much the experience on them that made me want to talk about, it was how I felt the next day. Possibly, it was still in my system I don't know. For the first time in god knows how long, I woke up with hope. I woke up feeling happier and more positive about life then I'd ever felt. I felt like I could achieve anything, I felt like I wanted to explore life, challenge myself, I had a new appreciation for life. That day, my love for travel came back. I felt like I could do anything, be anything, I actually could travel and tick off goals and dreams. The day after eating my second, I felt a total sense of peace and calmness with my life. No thoughts about depression, anxiety, no worries for all the problems in my life. It was like I could go through life and everything would work itself out, everything would be ok. It felt amazing and although I won't be doing this much, I just had to say in the past 2 days I've felt better than I have in around 6 years. 

My partner even commented on my change and thinks I may need to be on medication for my depression. I guess another question for you guys is, has being on medication helped you?

632,t3_dkjl11,"My previous failures are dragging me down, I've never gotten better. Just me being me.","Before I start, I'm extremely sorry if It  seems this post is so, so unorganised, random, weird and probably unreadable, but I hope someone hears me out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to begin with, I'm 17,  Male, I'm underweight and not happy. I've always had anxiety, at times it gets so bad I throw up. I often have lucid and vivid dreams that turn horrible. I wake up with so much built up fear sometimes I start to dry heave. This gets so much worse around exam times. In the past I have suffered from physical abuse from parents, which thankfully has completely stopped, as well as being picked on at every school I've attended.

When I was 15, I went to see a doctor, first they began with shoving a camera down my throat to see if I had any physical issues that would cause me to throw up, of course I knew it wasn't physical but I wouldn't speak up. After a couple of months they referred me to the Eating Disorder department where they gave me tones and tones of questions to fill out at home. That's as far as it goes, I refused to hand in my questionnaire, I lied to my parents and the hospital and said I haven't vomited in a long time and I feel much better. Nope. At the time, the only thing that calmed me down and made me feel so much better was drugs and cigarettes. I did it as often as I could, at lunch time during school, after school, before school, during the weekend, at home when everyone was asleep. One day, I came home and my parents smelt the disgusting smell of cigarettes and they were furious. They're very religious and this behaviour of mine wasn't imaginable to them. They took my phone, my computer, demanded that I cut ties to my closest friends at the time because my parents said they were the cause of it. I wasn't allowed to leave the house for the entire summer holiday and they took my money and stopped giving me pocket money.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward till now (1 year). They're always suspicious of me, I'm not allowed to go out with friends often and If I am, I have to specify exactly where I'm going, who i'm going with, when I'll be coming back. I get very little money for lunch (£1 per day to eat at school so I usually just buy a 99p Energy Drink). I'm not allowed to play video games (I've always played games to distract me, It's the only other thing that helps with my anxiety and depression) because they blame it on why I've failed my exams (which meant i'll have to drop my courses and pick new ones and stay for an extra year in school/6th form, the UK is weird and stupid). I can't bring myself to study to be honest which makes everything so much worse because I have the capability to be an A* student but I just don't have the mental endurance to do so. I'm always tired so I fuel myself with ridiculous amounts of caffeine.

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like my problems are so insignificant to everyone else's, yet I still cry and complain about my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I often think about suicide but I can't bring myself to do it. I feel like I just exist to exist. No one cares.

&amp;#x200B;

I love computers, programming and games but I can't pursue it because of my parents and my grades. If I wasn't such a failure of a son maybe my parents would of never ever had a reason to be strict with me. If I had good grades maybe I'd be able to keep on doing the things I love. I hope reincarnation is real, and maybe I can have another go at life. I have many other issues that I forgot to mention. Maybe if I forgot then it wasn't such a big of an issue after all. I love writing and being creative but how can I be creative when I can't wake up energised in the morning and I can't sleep relaxed at night and the only option I have everyday is to either study, or sleep but I can't bring myself to do either.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I supposed to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Again I'm sorry this post has such bad structure and everything and I probably can't put my feelings to words better than others, and I have little issues compared to others. I wasted everyones time I'm sorry.

636,t3_dk71f9,My worst fear every night is waking up in the morning.,"I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, every medication makes life, and my mind, worse. 

I wake up becore 6 am for work on the opposite side of town, attempt a series of impossible tasks. Instead of succeeding at my job, I spend my days doing the majority of everyone else's job description in an attempt to keep this branch of my national company afloat. No one else seems to mind the effort I put in.

I stay 2 hours late to feel some sort of accomplishment for today... it doesn't work. On my traffic ridden trip home, my stomach curdles and the feeling of nausea settles in. It's a combination of knowing I didn't accomplish what i needed to at work, and that as soon as i get home, my wife heads to bed to rest up for 3rd shift. This leaves me with the kids.

5 girls between the ages of 12 and 15, and a set of 3 year old twin boys. The girls want nothing to do with me, as I am not the biological father of the majority of them. All they want is to rot into every seat of furniture in the house, in front of every form of entertainment, filling it with shit quality tik toks and videos of total strangers chewing with their mouths open just so the rest of the world can hear it. Who the hell enjoys this? They show nothing but disrespect and total irresponsibility. They create 95% of the mess, and only clean up about 5% when they are forced to, and usually argue and bitch the whole time, making a simple 5 minute task into a 30 minute argument that results in the loss of their phone, which only escalates everything already coated in dismay.

The boys are my best friends, and are always by my side. ALWAYS. But they are toddlers. They know the only good things in life are me, their tablet, bath time and Ryan's toy review. They learn more from their sisters than I have time to correct. They have learned that 1. If you repeat what you want a million times, it is better than being patient. 2. If you hit someone, or cuss, or spit on someone, it's hilarious and worth repeating. 3. Being louder than everyone else is how to be heard. 4. They don't have to listen, and being punished for misbehaving is really just me being an asshole. 5. Cleaning up after themselves is optional, and also the most ridiculous rule they have ever heard of. 6. So much more bullshit that I don't have time to list. 

Sports, pick-up/drop-offs homework, late dinner that everyone but me complains about, and a million can I do this, will you do that, begging to be paid for chores because that is the only reason  they would willfully do them. Fight the boys to bed, fight the girls to keep it down while I do so. My wife wakes up to spend her daily 5 minutes with me, which usually leads to an argument about how my short comings are not important to her, or how (despite the inability to focus on my own thoughts due to the constant static buzzing in my head that prevents a single thought from reaching completion) I never listen, or pay attention to her needs. I can't even muster the energy or desire to take a shower once or twice a month, or brush my teeth, or eat 3 meals a day. How can I even begin to take care of all 8 of you perfectly? She leaves for work, and leaves me to thoughts of only being a nuisance to her, and how she and the kids would probably be better off without me. 

Next is arguments about how they are too old to go to bed at 9 on a school night, and how unfair it is that her older sister can stay up til 930. But now my patience is thinner than it was last night when all the same shit happened. Finally, it's just me. All to get time to myself, which is useless. Nothing is mildly interesting anymore. No show, no game, no book, or anything seems worthwhile. Fuck it, just go to bed. 

But that's no good, pitch black room, only the glow of the ""off"" led on the TV is left to see. Eyes wide open, burning from dryness and exhaustion, brain throbbing from the imaginary tell-offs I give my wife. Then this thought... every night, ""Don't go to sleep, it only makes tomorrow rear it's nasty fucking head! Maybe this will be the day I just don't wake up."" The clock ticks to early morning as I finally drift off. No dreams anymore. Just a split second before I awake to my 3 year olds coming to make it impossible to sleep with headbutts to the bridge of the nose, knees and elbows to the kidneys, and a comforter that no longer is usable as it is tangled amongst them. That's ok, their body heat cooks me, almost causing me to liquify.

Another split second passes... Beep. beep. beep. Less sleep than yesterday, and certainly not enough to make it through the day. 

Fuck... maybe tomorrow will be the day it happens. It's a shame my parents instilled me with a moral code that makes the thought of taking my own life full of guilt, disappointment, and regret that doesn't go away- all for a thought.

She told me i should tell them it makes me feel that way and to ask for a month without them bothering me about it and then after the month we can open the conversation again. My dad said no and that they’ll stop when i get a job. The thing is they’re just making me feel more overwhelmed and that makes me want to stay in bed even more. But at the same time i feel like an absolute FUCKING pussy being like “wah im depressed and anxious thats why i dont have a job”. I know they think that im just lazy and honestly whose to say im not.

And I don’t know how to deal with just being a “passerby “ when these people mean so much to me but nothing in their lives. Not even memorable to them. But I think of them all the time. And I wonder why I was ever even born when I was never wanted. And why people said they loved me when they didn’t, and I never asked them to say they did. I don’t fit in or belong anywhere. And no one gets it, because they have a friend or family member that is there for them. I have no one. No one to talk to. No one to call in an emergency. No one to call to tell me I’m not just a worthless piece of shit who should end it. So I have to scream out into the ether that is the internet hoping a lifeline is out there to pull me back from the edge. I really just can’t do this anymore. Everyone and everything rejects me. I have no real connection with anyone. I have never been loved unconditionally. And at this point in my life it’s highly unlikely it will ever happen.

I’m a chameleon and become whatever the other person is and wants. It’s still not good enough. I’ve given up myself over and over. And I still end up alone and worthless.

I also have been depressed for a few years and feel like I will never get better. Some days I’m so anxious and I have leave my apartment and drive around to just not go into panic. I am so sad most days and feel passively suicidal very often. I have tried to see a therapist but I just feel guilty that they have to listen to me talk and it makes me not go back. In addition, I struggle with anorexia, as well as chronic tension headaches and lock jaw. My body hurts. 

I feel so alone in the city I live in and the friends I have I don’t feel close to. The guy I was seeing doesn’t care for me anymore and it makes me sad. He says we’re still good friends, but I just feel like I’m bothering him, so I don’t actually have a friend in him. I feel like I have no one here.

I just feel trapped in my current life. I feel like I can’t leave school because of my debt and I’m already halfway through.

No.

It's an insult to people with social anxiety to say that I suffer from it. How dare I accuse others of faking happiness while I do the same fucking thing every god dam day. If society is incompatible with joy then why the fuck am I not working to change that?

Going to work, same thing.
Hanging out with friends is always meh, I am there just because I feel obligated to do it, and I don’t go out that often,  very rarely in fact.

657,t3_dkgwde,My sister is anorexic.,"Hi, so I'm using this new account because I don't want it linked to my main account.


My (17M) sister (13F) told me yesterday that she's been throwing up her food for the past month and that she's trying not to eat. She told me that there are some days that she doesn't eat, and as her brother I'm really scared for her. She told me not tell our parents because she is scared of how they're going to react (they're not from r/insaneparents but my mom sometimes exaggerates some situations, so she's scared it will happen) and I had to promise her that.
She's very conscious about her body (she thinks she is fat but honestly she really isn't) and very depressed as we live in a foreign country that she really made her home for the last 3 years but we are returning next July and she has no friends in our home country.


I don't want to break my promise to her so that I don't ruin her trust in me, but on the other hand I know that she must talk to someone about that, because obviously at my age there's nothing I can do to make her healthy again. I had to force her to eat some rice and chicken now because she hasn't eaten all day (it's late afternoon here) and she did after 15 minutes of trying to convince her. I'm also trying to convince her to speak to my mom but she says she doesn't want to.

I am reaching a point where in a week i cry 3-4 times in a shower. I still respect my parents but i don't think i can do that if this continues.

They made fun of me all the time, and made my life a living hell. I started dating somebody, and he used to have depression really bad, but he learned how to work through it. I asked him for help and would be honest with him, and he started distancing himself from me, and then cheated. 

I want help and advice. I have already attempted suicide, and I am contemplating doing so again. I’m afraid asking for help is what’s sabotaging all my friendships and relationships.

I'm a hermit. Stay at home, play video games,and only time I go socialize with society, is at the gym. Even them I awkward, and I'm paranoid that everyone senses it. I can't have a normal conversation without the anxiety. I recently loss my job. (Ethics vs morals kind of thing) and that broke me. I've never cried so loud. I collapsed to the floor, felt useless, like my purpose was done. I could never tell what I felt, until I saw a video with Tyson Fury, a boxer, who explained it perfectly. I feel alone all the time. I feel like I always need to prove myself, or people will usually find out im damaged. I always wanted to inspire, motivated, and help people not get into ""The Abyss"". Thing is, I'm in it deep. When my gym session is about to end, I get upset because I don't want to go back home to play video games, but I do. It's more of a chore than something to enjoy. I'm the process of starting a new job, a career job, and it won't be 3 months till I get full benefits. I don't want to be medicated anymore. Yet I feel like I can't get by a day without them. They've made me anxious when speaking to people, I've lost all creativity I've had. The ambition is gone. I feel like a burden when I talk to people I know about my problems, that I don't even mention it. Like screaming loud but no on hears me. I can't even pretend to be happy.

Who to talk to. I'm pessimistic because all I know is rejection and failure. If I get the ""you'll get through this."" Comments, I'll appreciate your time and effort, but you don't even know me and I don't want to type everything out. Im not sure if I'm fighting an anxiety attack, or if I'm delaying one.

665,t3_dkgskr,Feel like I'm on my way to dust.,"This year has been a hell of year. People I've talked to have agreed with me on that. I'm 34 recently single but it didn't start there. I feel like this year has just dealt hit after hit and there's no stopping it. Everything seemed to start in January when one of my best friends got diagnosed with cancer. It was a big hit for everyone cause she's so young and I think of her as a little sister. If I could I would have made a crossroads deal to switch places but I did my best to be there for her as much as possible. This put a strain on my relationship, it was a weird situation for me and well everyone to be in because my ""sister"" is my ex ex's sister. I helped raise her and took care of her. So the sibling bond developed. So my last gf was someone I saw like forever with but this whole situation really strained it for us. I broke down you know after the news hit. Wasn't fair. Usually how it goes. But a job I was getting hired for suddenly dropped me and I had been waiting months to get a response and did all the onboarding stuff and yeah that just got taken away and never found a reason why.   


My dog got sick and wouldn't eat and just got worse, more arguments with my gf and  I started to get worse physically. So I decided to leave and that hurt a lot. So much more than the last relationship felt like I made a bad decision after getting out of the hospital that day. Anyway so after that was a few weeks of hell. Started leaning on some good friends that we're also dealing with heavy issues and we became a support group. Hanging out talking that sort of thing. Then one day I get a call that one of them ""checked out"" and we were devastated cause they were a couple just two days later I get another call that the other one had a car accident and didn't make it. So that left me alone. Other friends thought that it was just a terrible thing to happen but I couldn't really talk with them like I did with Allie and Paul. I miss them terribly. I mourned was sad and thought this isn't what they would want and would like me to push forward. So I started slowly doing things out of my comfort zone. Started doing open mics and putting myself out there. Then the physical issues started hitting me harder. During this time I met someone new she was nice. Pretty and we had a lot in common. We hit it off. Made plans to see Godzilla together. But I had to postpone our plans due to my health and we stayed in contact.  While I was bedridden for a month we stopped texting. things with the ex seemed to just be degrading too a lot of arguing and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day I got a chance to surprise the new girl but you know wasn't letting my feelings get to heavy cause well fresh from  a break up and no idea if we would work things out and get back together. I still do love her but the new girl seemed like a good direction and maybe a possibility of something new i don't know. But my cousin decided I was depressed long enough so he said let's go surprise her. I found out she died. And all I could tell myself was damn that sucks. That's what I get for hoping. I guess that hit me hard because after that I just got low and couldn't walk anymore. Was in and out of the hospital. Was placed on leave from work to figure it out but my left side of my body was failing. Everything hurt. My exes both came back in my life for some weird reason maybe because I was in bad shape but still confusing. I knew what I wanted with my ex and told her but she said I don't know and we stopped texting as my surgery came around. Started doing PT and thought I was getting better but now it's come back and is now hitting my right side too. Everything hurts. Meds didn't help. Therapy didn't seem to help. The only thing I could remember was that driving was where I felt at peace. and I can't do that anymore. My dog died after holding on for so long. Then the friends that never talked to me started talking to me cause their relatives died and those relatives were my friends too so that hit hard again. So I don't know what's honestly going to happen next. I'm in and out of the hospital again. Docs still don't know what's going on. Nerve damage, spinal damage I don't know. But the pain is keeping me up every night and I just remember everything that happened. Lossing everything. Not sure if I'll ever get anything back. Breaking up with my gf was the biggest mistake ever and I'm trying to live with it but physically declining makes it hard to live with. I'm just so tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of waking up and wondering if anything good will happen. I guess waking up is good for family. I hate the way that my mom gets sad because I'm not getting better. I can hear the pain in her voice as she watches her son physically declining. Also my grandma chokes back tears. Everyone prays for me and hopes and maybe something good will happen. I don't know. As far as my job I miss it. I love my job. I enjoyed helping and teaching people. I can't even do that. It's like I lost myself and I'll never be back to that strong person again.

Next year I took admission again in college, but was deeply influenced by religion. I dropped out, set out to preach and save the world, only to turn out to be an atheist. Lost another year

My whole world swept off my feet after losing religion, so at that point it didn't matter which degree do I study now. Took admission in an arts degree. After high school, I had grades good enough for med school but now I'm in a degree which isn't rigorous at all.

684,t3_dkg801,Depression as a Competition?,"This is just some food for thought. But I feel like I observe something like this quite frequently, online and in person. 

Basically, it feels like when two people have similar diagnosis, they compete with each other as to who has it worse. For example, with depression and/or anxiety: who takes the most medicine, who’s been inpatient (or who’s been institutionalized the most), who gets the most panic attacks, etc. I get that they’re probably trying to relate to one another and share stories, but sometimes it really feels like a competition. And this is the wrong mindset because no matter who has “more” or “less” (for lack of better words), it’s just as serious and relevant. 

I’m definitely not labeling myself as the perfect person in this respect either. I’ve had my fair share of trying to “beat” others. My diagnosis is an ED so when I was around others, I’d always compare myself to them. Like I only stayed inpatient for x amount of time so I was superior (or inferior). It’s terrible. But I guess it was a way to justify myself because I always felt I was never bad enough to deserve treatment or help. 

For this reason I think being around other people with mental health issues can either be very helpful (when you support each other) or very harmful for the reason just explained. What do you think and how’s your experience with this?",depression
685,t3_dkg7p2,A rough year and I need advice,"I’m a 22y/o male and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didn’t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. 

I’m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. I’m in my 4th year of uni and I’ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, I’ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and I’m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so I’m going to talk about my year and how’s it’s been the worst and best year I’ve had in a very long time. 

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldn’t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who I’ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and I’ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. 

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our “flat” (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldn’t, that it wouldn’t work out and that the people I’m moving in with aren’t who I think they are and it won’t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly. 

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now I’ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when I’ve taken MDMA I’ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and that’s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldn’t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that I’ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month I’ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I haven’t had a great life and the smallest things get to me. 

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didn’t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldn’t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didn’t have the tension and added stress. 


(I’m sorry this story jumps a lot, there’s so much content that I can’t really focus) 


I didn’t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I don’t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and that’s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldn’t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they weren’t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didn’t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didn’t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didn’t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. 

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor I’ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didn’t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. 

I lost my two best friends, and my brother. 

It’s been just over 2 months since I’ve moved out and I’m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchat’s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease I’m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still haven’t paid, and unable to afford. I’ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I don’t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I haven’t stopped crying, I’ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I can’t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and it’s hard to see the positive ahead. I’ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, I’m a couple thousand dollars in debt, I’m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I can’t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I can’t help but think it’s the only way out. I don’t know what to do or who to speak too. I can’t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So I’m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. I’m lost and hopeless and I think it’s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I don’t think I can do this anymore.

This is supposed to be one of my most 'memorable' birthdays but it's already my worst one yet. I know I won't be going anywhere or doing anything special because its just not a possibility. All I can think about is how my life is literally over. My mom forced me to drop out of school when I was 11 by taking me overseas to her home country (unwillingly) so she could start a business. Which never happened. This place is so underdeveloped that there arent even actual good schools here. I sit around, no friends, barely going outside, barely talking to anyone other than my siblings, and I feel like I'm wasting my life away. Or like its basically over. Because I feel like I can't fix the situation I'm in. No birthday messages from old friends, nothing. I want to die but I'm afraid I think.

695,t3_dkg2nf,Its not okay right now.,"I use my posting on reddit to keep track of my mental health, because when I want to reflect on bad feelings/events its very common I mildly repressed something and self doubt. Reddit is good because its actually more lowkey than the obvious notes app/diary, and has time stamps. No need to interact/read, but its alright to. Its just a lot if text, so I dont expect anything

Its not been good. Ill just say it. I left that weird, emotionless state and was more in touch with my feelings. I used to wish I could cry/only be able to cry at ""scheduled"" times, like a few times a month, having to listen to sad music for 15 minutes. A little funny when I think of it, but upsetting I would be emotionally frozen. I left that to not being able to control the emotions I had. I guess I felt bare from feeling bad (versus feeling dissasociated), as I had almost been in tears in front of a teacher Im close to for having for 3 years, and she could see something was wrong I think. But if I explained my home situation to her I would really have an uncontrollable breakdown. So in order to cope with these emotions and frustrations, I set to make everything okay. I heard positive thoughts even when they feel fake at first help. I know this is true because thats how I made myself happy with my appearance. Id used to want to hurt myself or wish I was someone else for what I thought I looked like, but I practiced complimenting myself on my favourite features in the mirror until my pupils literally got bigger! And then I did that with the features I once hated. (That one is a genuinely great idea, btw.) But the way I tried to apply that lesson to my overall mental health wasnt so positive. I told myself ""Its ok! And if it feels not ok think its ok! Make it ok!"" Which wasnt so much positive thinking, more like lets pretend melanie has 0 issues. So when my family acted like shit, I gaslighted myself by saying ""Oh theyre just a bit dysfunctional, every family is!"" Or when I wanted to cry Id think ""Its ok, as long as I believe its ok itll be ok!"" 

I wasnt okay in the first place because a few weeks ago... I got yelled at for asking about therapy. I had gone to therapy for a few weeks. I told my parents it was for anxiety when it was for a lot more problems than that, because I guess they think anxiety is more valid than depression. My mom took me out of therapy despite my wishes, saying in what would be my last appointment we'd go ""every 3 months"" because it was expensive. After that appointment, we never went again, Its been maybe a year. No appointment 3 months after that. I thought Id give them the credit that they only knew a small, small amount of what was going on, and from what they knew I didnt need therapy that much. I tried to tell them I was depressed after that and got backlash, I think they felt I was blaming them for my mental illness (which. It is a lot on them lol but I did NOT present it to them like that at all). I even talked to my dad abput killing myself, starting as jokes but ending in me looking at him in the eye and without a laugh saying I wish I was dead/nonexistent. They didnt seem to be concerned and just told me to stop saying that. So... No therapy I guess. ""Too expensive"".

Well, until they talked about paying for my cousins therapy. Shes going through a lot of shit and honestly, Im glad theyre paying for her. However, Im REASONABLY PISSED that they took me out of therapy because it was ""expensive"" and then theyre paying for someone who may need it, but also, Im theyre kid? Theyre supposed to care about my issues too?? Some would argue before anyone elses?? I brought it up, I tried my best not to sound spiteful/mad about it and just approached it as ""whats going on?? why cant i go?"" My dad who I once regarded as the better parent lashed out at me and told me I was selfish for wanting therapy. He told me I needed to check myself and I was being awful and I had no issues and I didnt deserve therapy because I was privileged not to be mentally ill. Thats all his opinion, none of its true and I think he was just trying to convince himself. But it broke my heart. He told me hes not even paying for her therapy so I started this for no reason. The next morning I saw a check on the counter... For her therapy. I didnt know how to cope with this. What ""healthy"" way is there to cope with that anyway. Usually when my family does some shit like this I write it down before I forget/be gaslighted but I wasnt mentally available to recognize it happened. I only am now, a few weeks after. 

So I tell myself Im fine because how am I going to survive otherwise. I still dont know now what to do?? The closest thing Ive found to a healthy coping mechanism is planning my future. Im applying to a few places soon so I can make money, and I even talked to someone about being roommates. Its a while in the future, but I few people told me I had their couch to crash on. So theres that. 

And while thats the main issue at hand, someone Ive been friends with for a very long time hasnt been a good friend. And maybe I havent either. And Im so scared to come to terms with that Its Not Great. Shes got therapy, shes got antidepressants, but shes choosing not to go to therapy (when its her mothers money for all of these things), shes purposely going off her ADs without her therapist knowing and without help getting off them right, ever since shes been off them/taking them randomly shes been snappy in a way that I dont need every day. I dont know what to do. I shouldnt be but Im not denying that Im jealous she has these resources and she isnt using them. And while its her choice to not take her meds, Im pretty mad shes choosing not to when shes such an angry, sad, bitter person off them who lashes out at her friends. I dont know what to do. I dont want to lose the idea of her but I cant stand this. 

I dont necessarily need advice or even support, although its appreciated. Ive heard what I should do. Its not a matter of ""I dont know what to do"" as in please give me advice/help. Its this is such a difficult reality to face. Ive been thinking of what happens when I break it off with my mom and dad (because I cant handle living with them/contact). What happens to my brother. My older relatives. My aunts and uncles. The weddings of cousins ill miss or funerals, or memories with good family I might miss. How they might talk about me when Im gone. I know what I might do. But when I say I dont know, I know. Im just desperate because what I really dont know is how to cope right. And 9/10 Im coping ""right"" for what my situation allows... Which is not much.

699,t3_dkg2dg,I want to kill my parents.,"I cannot take it anymore now. Yesterday, I told my mom that I got 1350 on the October SAT, she instantly became mad and started saying that I didn't study for it at all and all I did was playing video games. Before I even told her, I have expected her reaction would be like this. I have told her that I did study for it and I did not play any video games this week until this Friday after school. But she did not care and just kept shouting. Even though I already got 1410 on the August SAT, she still thinks I should get 1500. She did not even know how hard it was for me to get 1410 after I have studied myself and in two SAT tutoring classes. English is not even my native language. It's like she did not even know that I am in the US for only three years. This was the first fight this week.

Tonight, my dad opened my door and asked me if I am playing video games. I said no and then he responded that if I played any video games today then just say it. He obviously asked if I am CURRENTLY playing video games but he just changed the question. I told him that I was not playing video games and stop accusing me of things I did not do. That was the second time he has done this to me and I told him I had enough of this. I then shouted back to him about everything my mom has said to me last night. I told him that neither of you and her is reasonable. He just responded that he would not have bought me this laptop if he was not reasonable. I was so pissed because he has used the same damn excuses a million times. It's not like everything he does is ok because he bought me a laptop.

Then just minutes after the fight with my dad, my mom came home. She opened my door and began talking to me. I was apparently annoyed and said what is the problem again. She thought my attitude was terrible and then started shouting. She brought up the SAT again even I told her that it is the past and I do not wanna talk about it anymore. But she did not think it is past already and here we go again. In the end, she even said my dad and I are so lazy and without her care, both of us would have an awful life. 

I really cannot take it anymore. I had enough of those freaking same bullshits happening to me again and again and again. I want to kill my parents now and then kill myself. I am so afraid and mad right now. What should I do?  😢",depression

Agony takes more forms than we care to admit but there is nothing worse than facing it alone.  Some choose to make their pain public but the one sitting in a corner waiting for something good to happen or the ones who smile and yet wish for finality, painfully live amongst the ignorant. Living in anguish Untold and unseen is parallel to dying slowly by choice.  I feel and think that no one wants to understand how I feel and it is slowly eroding my will to live and yet I trudge on as if there is some golden carrot in front of me.  What I want I cannot attain and what I feel I cannot describe and it has left a void encompassing my being.  I want to smile and laugh and forget life's  discouraging attempts at emotional mutilation but it's  exceedingly difficult when I can't admit just how down trodden I feel, even to myself.  I am dirt.  I am trampled dog shit.  I am the person I am despite your best efforts for perfection.

I started high school the same year too and had trouble making friends or talking to people(which is weird since i've always been talkative and outgoing my whole life) i also started being self conscious about everything the way i looked, dressed etc. I also made no friends in hisghscool either. My self esteem and confidence gradually deteriorated throughout highschool to the point where i was afraid to leave my room and id skip all my classes in  junior and senior year to only show up for tests/exams( i dont know why i felt anxious because i never got bullied). I ended up failing senior year and repeated (still suffered from anxiety and was afraid of leaving my room), also a point to note is my coping method was binge watching tv shows thats literally all i did throughout highschool nothing else. I also continued this habit in college for the first 2 years and now im in 3rd year (im 22 years old) and realize how much i missed out on and want to change. the only problem is I can't i tell myself everyday that ill go to college and pay attention, ill start eating healthy, ill go to the gym, try making friends etc. but im too afraid to leave my room i mentally can't bring myself to do any of these things, I even booked an appointment with a counsellor and cancelled it because I felt anxious.

Instead of confronting me about it he decides its best to ignore me in person... and i let it slide for a week and thats when i finally talked to him and asked him whats up... he told me he hated how i would jokingly deny something that was obvious like when i muted my mic and i told him i didnt or when i would tease him about this girl that he liked and he never made it clear that these things were annoying him so i apologize and i ask him if we're cool and he says yea. 

but even after that he still continues to act fake and would ignore me in person so another week later i ask him if theres any bad blood and he tells me ""i dont think we can go back to the way we used to be, a lot of our friends do this, they do something messed up and act like everything is ok"" ...... like i apologized and what i did was not even that serious

and at this point its hurting me to try to keep being best friends with him hes being acting like this for 4 weeks and literally greets everyone BUT me.... not once has he ever apologized to me about something that has offended me but i shrugged it off

this will take me awhile to get used to, its even harder cuz i have to see him 2-3 times a week and we go to the same youth group every sunday so it sucks having to see him be nice to everyone but me. 

but i think its for the best cuz hes a pretty shitty person, hes a trump supporter, he thinks being gay is a choice... he says he hates racism but literally told me in my face that its a scientific fact that asians have small penises but if i ever made a comment about his race he would make it this big deal. 

even tho he is a shitty person it still hurts to lose a friend",depression
710,t3_dkdqjr,i must like overthinking," The pressure and stress comes in droves and when you might think you might be feeling something uplifting it comes and takes it away. Even fear, even calmness, even gratitude, even happiness or mirth cannot make it better. You just suffer in the same way continuously, sometimes being lazy, but telling yourself that you'll get out maybe and never actually doing so. Things are just illusions and distractions, you'll wake up and realize nothing really changed, and any pain that hits you will be the same as always, and yes, you will always on some level go back to believing it is all your fault. If you were better before, you're not better now, you're worse, for all your desperation and cowardice. Just making an impulsive, uncertain action fraught with mysterious but probably terrible possibility is not enough; you're just operating under the same cowardice as always in those moments, and also, you are always just running the same loops, feeling pathetic in the same way, looking at the same shit and not able to change a thing, while everyone else is seemingly together and looking towards the future. Perhaps I am too influenced by other people and potential things, and I look too far ahead with stupid hopes and dreams - not that I would admit to having them, ever, but at the same time most contemplation I have is neverending and circular and unfocused and undirect, I react to panic, I say too much, I just don't get it. I can't interact with others or do shit, and somehow it's my own cowardice, my own inability, my own weakness which would mercilessly leave me behind, and that's just how it is. I walk in fear while knowing most things are futile, and I avoid everything that I can practically think of. Also, my understanding of practically everything is incomplete, due to my fearfulness, and I know it will only bring inevitable pain and uncertainty and more weakness and cowardice. I'm just babbling, I'm not getting anywhere.  ",depression

712,t3_dkhpf7,"Need some advice, lost in life","I'm 20, starting to get depression from my current state in life. Decided to go to community college for computer programming, but it hasn't been going well at all. I went since I otherwise have zero experience, can't find any job, and thought perhaps it could be something I'd develop an interest in along the way. Unfortunately not. It's been difficult and I have sought out help at the school, but there's little hope in salvaging my grades.

I'm quite shy and have anxiety. I've been isolated for a while in my room with no one to talk to except my parents. I have no friends. It's always been difficult for me to approach or interact with others. I obviously have never had a relationship, and can't remember ever holding a conversation with a girl around my age before.

Tried exercising and eating healthier for a few months, but I couldn't gain any weight. I weigh just 120 lbs.

While my parents are supportive and have done a lot for me which I'm grateful for, beyond that I have difficulty relating to them or my entire family since they're all older, very evangelical, hold really ignorant beliefs and often say a lot of terrible things (anti-vaxxer rhetoric, homophobia, racism, etc.)

My parents have questioned me on how I'm doing in school so far. I told them during a long conversation that I just want to back out and spend more time focusing on myself, but they want me to stay and pay for a tutor to help. I just told them, ""I don't want you paying more for something I won't be continuing with or have any interest in."" They then said, ""We don't want you to end up as a failure, sleeping in your room all day.""

Truth is, I just don't have any interests or motivation in life. I don't know what I want or what to do. It's even difficult for me to play a video game. All I do and what I have done ever since 13-14 is stare at a computer screen and sleep. What can I do?",depression

720,t3_dkhmcg,"I’m not necessarily sad or anything, but i still think about killing my self all the time","i wouldn’t say i’m depressed, and yes i know what depressions like because i went through it for about 3 years of my life. anyways, i think about killing myself every now and again, it’d be so easy. the only things that have stopped me from offing myself (again, i’m not depressed. and if i am, me and my shrink are unaware of it) are my mom and my sisters, especially my mom tbh. 

i think i’ve had a pretty bad upbringing. i’ve had 3 dad’s but thankfully only one mother. my mom’s been my rock as long as i can remember. my second father ‘adopted’ (legally he’s my father but not biologically) abused my mother daily, mentally and physically and i was between the age of 1-12 years old while this happened. for some reason, my minds completely blocked out every memory of that time of my life thankfully; i say thankfully because if i remembered seeing my mom abused, i would’ve killed myself long ago. my second father is mentally abusive and 19 year old me still hears about how he mentally abuses her and it kills me for about a week, but my mind stops thinking about it about after a week or so generally. i can’t tell if my mind blocking out things like that is good or not.

i think about ending myself, making my moms life easier (i’ve never been easy to deal with, if i could change it i would. but i’ve been a high ADHD, socially incapable child and these past two years i’ve been abusing drugs and my mom knows about it but i don’t think she knows how to handle/stop it, but i can’t stop myself. i tend to think if i we’re gone her life would be easier, but hindsight shows me otherwise). the thing about all of this that’s weird is that i’m not necessarily depressed according to me and my shrink at least and yes i tell my shrink everything except for my thoughts about killing myself because i’m scared of putting myself in a psych ward.

anyways, TL;DR i’m not diagnosed (previously have been though) with depression, only anxiety currently. even though i’m not diagnosed with depression, i’m still suicidal. it sounds so easy, effortless and shit. is it normal to think about suicide way more than most people admit to? btw i’m sorry if this is hard to read, i’m drunk and coming off a high dose of amphetamines. these are the times suicide becomes a very viable option. if guns weren’t in a safe right now i’d be gone",depression

We both have depression so don't get me wrong, I know why she did what she did and I don't blame her for anything. It's just... it feels different when it's someone you love I guess. I wasn't there when she did it, so the first I saw of her after the attempt was in the hospital emergency room where the cops dropped her off. She seemed so normal and unperturbed, it was surreal  - it was almost possible to just think nothing had even happened, except that when I went back to the apartment to get her some essentials for the hospital wait I saw the chair she stood on, and the snapped pieces of the belt she put around her neck. I can still see them as vividly as if they were right in front of me now. I guess when the cops broke down the door and found her she was lying unconscious on the floor and the only reason she survived is because the fucking belt snapped after she blacked out, and the suicide hotline called the pigs when she hung up on them.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while I tried to just pretend like nothing happened but it's not working. I've started cutting again and I just want to die all the time. I can't process the fact that the only reason I didn't lose one of the most important people in my world was random chance and a shitty cheap belt that couldn't hold her weight, and if she had died I wouldn't have even been there to say goodbye. The only thing keeping me around is that I just got a little taste of what it would be like for the people in my life if I died.

741,t3_dkh6qa,I have developed severe hypochondria through my depression.,"For some reason over the last year, I have developed a genuine fear of terminal illness to the point where I feel like I have got one but its not yet been detected. I have tried to be rational and realise its all probably in my head, but it doesn't stop me worrying. It is becoming a huge problem. If I have an off stomach I am convinced I have bowel cancer. If I feel a muscular pain, I am convinced my bowel cancer has spread to somewhere else. I avoid the doctors because I dread the news. I probably don't have anything wrong with me, but I feel like I am going to be the one in my circle who gets taken down by cancer or a young death. I am genuinely obsessing over it to the point where I feel like getting a terminal diagnosis would almost feel like a relief (whilst being horrifying).

I have two very young children and I am just so afraid of leaving them behind. I am very aware that my current mental state is not doing my health any good. Does anyone else experience this? Any words of advice would be very much appreciated.",depression

I’m so broken that instead of falling in love of someone of my same age I get a crush on a teacher. Why am I so weird, I don’t know. I can’t stop thinking on her but is different from other crush that I have had. The other ones I didn’t felt enough for them but other people could feel the same. I didn’t felt guilty for having fantasies with her because it was NORMAL. This is not. I can’t stop thinking about her and how is 100% impossible. And is not because of my low self esteem, is because she is married, a lot of years older than me and perfect, not for me even if I were her age. This is not a crush that my psychologist can say “you can try. Nothing is impossible” she literally says to me “you have to know it’s impossible. You are not going to have this”.

I usually just sit on the couch in the other room during it or don't participate in a big conversation because I'm thinking about death, how I hate the situation and on and on until I'm just totally down and nearly start crying. I have always been able to hide it or excuse it as something else though

Then all of a sudden it will go away. Sometimes it's an event that happens that causes it and sometimes it's just all a sudden better. I feel back to normal (normal as in chronic depressed, but not 'disfunctional at a family party' like these little bursts)

746,t3_dkdzki,"3rd year University/College student,","So I'm currently a Junior in college and I've reached a point where I can't take any of this shit anymore, between ""trying"" to keep up with my grades which is really just me procrastinating and doing a piss poor job or just straight up missing exams or assignments and using my depression/anxiety as a crutch to make up the work, but even then when it comes time to actually make up that assignment I just don't give a fuck, its meaningless to me and I really don't want to be in college at all I know that my depression is probably the reason for this as I began to really notice and suffer at the start of my second year though in hindsight the general anxiety and ESPECIALLY the social anxiety have been with me my whole life. In high school I couldn't really make friends, I have great friends now because they approached me first but even then I feel like I'm losing them because they don't like being around my sorry ass and I feel like they just look down upon my depression/anxiety because they don't have the resources to understand it fully. I used to get mad at the way other people would treat me for opening up about my mental health, including my parents (who even after a medical diagnosis and recommendation for medication by a psych ward psychiatrist) still just tell me to think positively or all of this is immaturity (my dad loves throwing the immaturity one in my face as if this were a fucking debate). Yet the thing is though I don't get mad at my friends or family because I realize they are mentally incapable of comprehending my situation, the downside to this is that I have to fake being happy around them if I want as little conflict in my life as possible and I now keep almost everyone in my life besides two people completely in the dark because like I said, its just not worth my time trying to explain it to them when I'll probably just hate myself more in the end. If my parents weren't so generous to pay for my education and continue to pay even after finding out I'm extremely depressed I would not be here on my own dollar. Being nearly $100k in debt for this fucking terrible place that is college (Im in a frat too but that only helps on weekends) boggles my mind, especially when your degree isn't even valued unless its some impossible major because every egotistical parent MUST send their kid to college because the Jones's son down the street is now going to school to be a brain surgeon or rocket scientist or whatever the fuck upper-middle class and wealthy Americans view as successful. If it were up to me, and please don't tell me it is, I'm in a situation where my parents have control over every decision I make because they pay for nearly everything I do and own (I still work and have my own money and some things I pay for but the big things I obviously can't afford at 19 they pay for) even though I never asked for these things and I wasn't a spoiled brat growing up they still throw it back in my face whenever I get bad grades or come forward about my inner thoughts and mental health. Now I know this is getting fuckin long to read but another major thing is that due to my social anxiety I am still completely unable to talk to girls past the point of being just friends. I lost my virginity because one girl on my floor freshman year wanted to fuck me so I did just to lose my virginity, and because I didn't want a relationship (she said she didn't want one either but I think she lied) or because the sex was so bad that I couldn't finish after 45 mins (and I was actually the one who asked if we could stop having sex, she wanted to keep going) or whatever other reasons, she felt it was only appropriate to start a false rape rumor about me and the girls on my floor avoided walking past my room because of it. I did nothing wrong I didn't encourage, force, or coerce her into anything and she even eventually apologized for the rumors one night but the damage it did to me still made my anxiety with women worse because I'm afraid if I try again this will happen, Ive had other failed relationships in the past, one girl that I still have feelings for two years later but no one knows at all because I'm embarrassed to say it and I know she obviously doesn't feel the same about me anymore since she's been dating guys since and they have all been dead beats which is what shocks me the most, am I really worse than the abusive assholes she finds? Anyways, Im afraid that Ill graduate college (if I graduate) still only ever having sex once but more importantly never having had a real relationship. Again I know this is long but I want to know if anyone else could relate to this (and Im sorry for you if you do) because I feel like everyone around me is a literal sheep.",depression

It didn’t hit me about how pathetic my life is until recently when I overheard my sister talking about me to a few of her friends.

I should be starting my career right now. All my old friends and family members my age are beyond where I am.

I can't seem to get a new job after I had to move out of state. So, I'm hemmorraging money. My inheritance that I already feel guilty about pissing away.

I was too depressed so I got caught in a loop of escapism that I forgot to pay the health insurance I had inherited from my now deceased mom. So, I might not have that anymore. I'm going to try to salvage it but I am not hopeful.

My permit has a hold on it which is temporary but now I have to wait longer to get my license and I feel the longer I wait the more afraid I will become of driving again.

I gained a bit of weight since my mom died and I can't seem to shave it off. I'm neglecting my health problems so that is probably why. But I can't find the mental strength to care anymore.

I live with my parents, which I guess isn't too bad at my age, but I'm still such a fucking embarrassment. I can feel that the next five years are going to be just as bad if not worse. I am trying to put myself out there more, going to school more next semester and such, but I know that I'm never going to find the happiness that I'm looking for. No one will want to be friends with me as I am, and once I come out as trans I'll find that even less want to be my friend then. The last five years have been the loneliest years of my life, and I know that it will go down from here.

The most painful memories are always those of the friends I lost. In particular, my best friend. My best friend saved me from suicide. He introduced me to his group of nonjudgmental friends when I had lost all my old friends. Then, years later, when he had moved away, I asked out someone in that friend group. When she said no, I was mean. I tried to manipulate her. Then, fraught with anger and guilt, I isolated myself from everyone. The last two years of high school and on have been spent in mostly isolation. I apologized to her just this year, and she informed me she didn't want to be my friend ever again. The nonjudgmental have judged me. Then, I went to my best friend, who I stopped talking to out of shame. I had to message a dozen times for a response. My best friend, the best friend I'll ever have, told me to stay away. This person who had saved me from suicide by taking me out of ostracization has now ostracized me.

All of this has done a palpable blow to my self image. I really do believe I'm a terrible person, just for manipulating that one time, and isolating. I want to hurt myself for how I act and look. I deserve the worst. I deserve to be hit, to be maimed and killed. I deserve all of the abuse I've gotten in my life.

775,t3_dkdeuq,"I wake up every morning with an aching body, tired an heavy eyes, a sinking mental state, and not looking forward to the day. And it keeps repeating.","I'm not quite sure how it started. But during my time away from home I've lost all motivation and cannot find happiness that'll last longer than an occasional laughter, which is quickly when I remember how sad I am. It all started when I left for basic training for the air force. I graduated basic feeling like I was on top of the world. I conquered something, a couple months prior, I deemed seemingly impossible. I had to go to follow on training at another base for my job I was assigned to. Overtime during those several months, any optimism I had chipped away every day. Relationships back home were failing with long time friends never replying or people close to me abandoning me. During training we would have tasks assigned to us, we observe someone doing a job and then repeat what they just did to see if we learned and could retain what we just saw. Two instances of me screwing up beyond belief. One job roughly took about 20 minutes to complete. I somehow managed to do it in 8 hours, taking up two days of our training for me to catch up. The ridicule was deserved and I knew that they were right. I sucked and I had to come to grips that I may actually be awful at my job I willingly chose. Another time I was involved with a small team which involves jacking up an aircraft. Long story short I accidentally relieved more pressure I was supposed to on my side and the wing almost collapsed and it could've seriously injured or killed another airman and myself. I was ridiculed and belittled for months, hearing the jokes and references every day. Everyone in that hangar knew I messed up. And for some reason, my coping or defense mechanism was to joke about how I should've died in that accident. That it would've out me out of my misery and would've saved the air force some money as they'd stop wasting their money from investing in me. But for some reason, my joking about dying or being killed wasn't a joke anymore as I actually ponder and consider putting an end to my disappointing start to my air force career and life.

Months later I get to my first duty station. The work is hard and I barely get any breathing time. But I knew I signed up for that so I didn't mind that. However the constant stress of trying to impress my supervision that I'm a step above other Airman is taxing on me. Whenever I mess up they make sure I'm aware of my mistake and that I don't forget it. Whether it's them joking to other people I suck at my job or me not handling the criticism as I interpret it as me actually being awful at my job. I go home everyday exhausted, sleeping immediately after and missing dinner most of the time. Then I have to go back to bed as I have to get up at 4 for work. A constant cycle of me being miserable all damn day is quite awful. Sometimes I think about how I felt back to when I messed up the jacking job and how I actually wanted to die. Now every night I think about killing myself. I always imagine myself playing Russian roulette with a revolver and seeing if today would be the big day.

I want to talk to a psychiatrist as there's posters all over base about seeking help. But I'm afraid I'll be told I'm not actually depressed or suicidal, that I'm actually just a little sad and that I'm making a mountain over a mole hill. I don't know what to do anymore.

I was raised that I shouldn't let someone's mood/actions control the tone of my day. It's literally every interaction, every person throughout the day my mood takes a 360 degree turn to whatever they are feeling regardless of my own state of mind.

783,t3_dkflc3,"Bf (23M) is depressed, how to help? What to do?","My (23F) bf (23M) of 9 months has been depressed for almost the entire time. He is sleeping all day and is neglecting his own health and hygiene. He is isolating himself and pushing people including family and friends away, I may also be too since he rarely wants to spend quality time together. 

We only do after I make a big deal out of it but I don't like doing that anymore. We end up seeing each other 3-4 times a month for the past 6 months even though we live 5mins away and don't have much stopping us from doing so otherwise. We talk everyday but not much or very deeply. We are not intimate although I wish to be. He says he is ashamed of himself although I reassure him truthfully that I think he's nothing but the most gorgeous guy and that I desire him. All this is making me feel neglected and disconnected from him.

When we do hangout he seems happy and smiles and we talk and have fun. Unless I'm wrong we both seem to genuinely enjoy spending quality time together. Which is why I am also confused as to why he rarely allows for it.

He suspects he may have bipolar, and I think is diagnosed with BPD. He is not currently in therapy but has gone back on anti depressants for 2 months now after going off them for a while. He is also having constant suicidal thoughts and talks about hoping he'll die soon. 

Has anyone experienced being like this or having someone they care about like this? What has helped or worked for them?",depression

785,t3_dkd77o,Depression coming back,"I had been suffering through some sort of depression for 3 years, although I was never diagnosed. I tried to OD last September but it didn’t work and I spent this whole winter self harming. I also ate a lot of my feelings and gained weight. I was so insecure that I decided to lose weight fast this summer, and I developed an eating disorder (again, not diagnosed). The thing is, as much as I hate this ED and how much it takes up my life, it made me happy for awhile that I was losing weight and getting compliments. However, now I’m at my goal weight and I still hate myself, probably more than ever. I feel so hopeless and miserable that all my thoughts revolve around food. I’ve realized that my ED is probably just a coping mechanism for my depression.

And now I’m back to where I was a year ago, completely depressed. I’m sitting on the bathroom floor after binging and purging, and I’m holding a bottle of pills. The only reason I haven’t swallowed them is because I know it won’t kill me and I’ll just end up in a lot of pain. I haven’t felt this hopeless since the spring. All I want to do is die.

I am not motivated to do well, can't get myself out of bed in the morning, and instead of taking my failures as a wake-up call, I am just relieved because it will be a while before I have to deal with them again.

Also, I have not made any friends. I have tried to, but they either talked to me just to help them with schoolwork or stopped talking to me after the first few times that they do. My only friends are my family and people I know since grade 6.

To make it worse, I am always anxious, constantly analyzing and solving non-existing problems - my own predictions of the future. Which makes it really hard to sleep or even sit down to do anything, leading me wanting to kill myself but not having the courage to.

Going through all of this while knowing some people are financially worse off than I am makes me feel like a little bitch, and shouldn't be complaining.

I’m always told that I’m “funny” and “smart” but I don’t see that I get good grades but it’s so easy. It reached the point where I disconnect my self from a lot of the feelings I feel of the people I care about. I got accepted to my dream school today and I felt nothing not even joy or happiness. One thing is that I don’t actively seemed depressed on the outside I still maintain good hygiene I still smile and talk with people but on the inside there’s a burning passion of me dying. I don’t want to kill my self but I wouldn’t be against an accident happening where I die as a result. The reason for all of this is multi pronged it’s mainly my upbringing and even though my family is alright my mom who loves me dearly has a hard time properly expressing her love or care, and as a result it lead to some tense confrontations  where  it boiled to the point where she told me to kill my self and she watched me drink rubbing alcohol in an attempt to kill my self. ( we forgave each other afterwards and we haven’t talked about it ever since but I’m pretty sure she actively tried to forget that day). But honestly the main reason Why I don’t feel like I’m good or worth it is that I’m not in a relationship or never had been. I’m not an ugly guy at least from what I’ve been told I’m pretty out going and I have friends that are girls so it’s not like there grossed from me or anything. But the fact that I’m a senior in Highschool and never had a relationship or even my “first kiss” it honestly destroys my self esteem. All my friends are in wonderful relation ships and I’m here all alone. It reached the point where I stopped feeling much emotion I know I touched on this before but I really feel next to nothing. I don’t talk with my parents like I used to I stopping feeling horny I know it sounds weird but I’m a teenage guy and nothing excites me I have some emptiness in my heart  that I feel I constantly ignore my friends when they call or I’ll call them back hours later even though I had no reason to ignore them initially.

Well I have very very bad depression. 
Now Iv dated this girl for almost 3 years. Almost.
The thing is, after a while she got very very emotionally abusive. She would mess with my feelings and make me feel bad about myself.
Made me think things were my fault.
I cried a lot. I mean a lot. She didn’t seem to care and would only stop when I got to the point where I was hurting myself (hitting, cutting, choking, slapping myself.) 
Now As I said in the title. I’m in love with her. 
Yeah I don’t know. I have a lot of feelings for her but I shouldn’t, plus she’s with a new guy (who is a drug addicted dick.) She was also my first girlfriend and well.. only girlfriend. So maybe that’s a part of it?
I still text her and she’s been a little nicer but not by a lot. She’s trying drugs, have sex with all kinds of people and is overall fucking up. 
Now i tired getting her medication, therapy and whatever. But her mom refused. I’m not sure why but her mom didn’t approve of meds. 
Also my family treated my ex so well. She was family. 
We’d take her places and to the movies. I’d go to the mall with her. I even spent some of the money for my braces on her clothes. My saved money. It’s weird because she would be such a caring angle in person.
She was so loving and cute. But when it came to texting and FaceTiming. She was a demon. 
Now I should mention she does have BPD, anxiety and depression. 
But my question to everyone is. 
How do I get over my abusive ex girlfriend.

so now I’m crying my self to sleep every night and when I’m around anybody It makes things worse i want to ask my friends for help but I’m starting  to doubt they’d care and I’m too anxious too anyway I don’t want to tell my parents because i would probably just get in trouble on a slight bright side thought I do have a crush but due to some past experiences I’m probably just going to end up not doing anything and living in anxiety or my stress I don’t know how to relax because nothing is fun anymore.

814,t3_dk5czi,First and final update,"I don’t think I’ve ever posted here before, or maybe I have. I can’t remember. For about the last four years I’d been struggling with low self esteem, OCD, depression, and social and generalized anxiety. Life for me felt awfully useless. My motto was “if this is life and then we die, that really fucking sucks.” I think that gives a little bit of insight as to who I was then.

Well, around five months ago my relationship with my abusive boyfriend ended. I was convinced that even negative attention was good attention if it saved me from being alone, so I took it pretty hard. At some point I decided that how I was living wasn’t healthy at all and I decided to actually get some help.

I went to my GP and told her everything. I told her that life felt meaningless. I told her that being out around people made me feel miserable and scared. I told her absolutely everything. She recommended me to a behavioral therapist, who then recommended me Zoloft.

So I’ve been taking my medication for about 3 months now. In addition to that, I did weekly therapy to help with my anxiety. I have made a complete recovery. It feels strange to say that I’m no longer depressed or anxious. My entire life has been flipped around. When I was able to notice the awesome things in life, I became a happier and more approachable person.

In that time, I’ve gotten promoted at my job, moved out on my own, made some awesome new friends and I’ve even started dating a nice guy. My confidence is higher than its ever been before. I am without a doubt very very happy. That’s all :)",depression

She never has, but she always threatens to. When she found out about all my self harm scars, she didn't care about the pain I was in.

I lost a lot of friendships and burned a lot of bridges. My family is dysfunctional. When I got to college the same thing started to happen. I couldn’t make a friendship last long.

When I finally met a girl I liked, I couldn’t make things work well. It was hard dealing with my mental issues while we dated. I had to fake being happy around her a lot of times. This resulted in me using weed to be high around her often. 

It helped for a while. I could smoke and have good conversations with her about stuff, or enjoy her company more. But when I couldn’t smoke, I turned into a cold hearted jerk, making it hard for us to handle conflict well. 

She eventually got fed up with my behavior. My anxiety ridden thoughts, which made her feel controlled and trapped. My depressed state made me appear boring and less intimate around her. I often argued with her endlessly because it felt normal.

When she finally left me, I couldn’t believe it. I knew I had to make those changes earlier. I should’ve talked to a psychiatrist for new meds, but I didn’t care. I expected my ex to put up with my issues, which ended up putting strain on her life and the relationship.

So she left me before I could make those changes. She will never get to see the improved me and it hurts. She was the only one to give me a chance with dating her and now she’s gone. I’m sure she can find a guy who’s more secure and happy than I was.

I wish I had the self respect to make these changes for myself. To say forget her she lost a good thing. But I can’t help but feel guilty. That I turned a good relationship into a toxic one. That she stuck by me thru so much shit and I thought she’d stay.

That if only I had sought help sooner, I could still be with her. But I kept making things worse. Texting her after the breakup. Making her act more hostile towards me as I wouldn’t leave her alone. I just want to be able to talk to her again and show her the changes. But I think I made her hate me now. 

It’s almost like what’s the point of wanting to seek help. I won’t be as happy as I was with her. No medication can replace the love and happiness I had for her. There’s no hope for a better woman out there because I had already found her but lost her. I hope she would text me sometime but I doubt that too. 

It also sucks coming from a dysfunctional family. I doubt a lot of good girls want to deal with that. Especially when they have normal families. And if you turn out toxic from it like I did, all hope is lost for a healthy relationship in the future. I couldn’t be healthy partner for her and I feel so much pain.",depression

For me the most frustrating thing about this third person perspective is realizing how Im the only one that has no role, or that has to play pretend to fit a certain type of person. It has also made me think about how lonely we are, and how insane it is that no one realizes how lonely they really are. A lot of people eventually come to terms with this loneliness and learn to live with it, but the fact remains, we really are alone. I feel this way especially around my family and over the years it has actually made me resent them a little bit, going to family gatherings, having the same old conversation with grandma, pretend how I remotely care about what they do with their lives, and then just silence and an awkward silence. My next step is then probably sitting on a couch and watch how people act around each other for the rest of the day. However, in a weird way, I also think that living my life with this perspective really allows me to really understand how absurd and pointless everything is, and although that may sound like something horrible I think its soothing knowing that anyone can live their life and enjoy what they enjoy without worries, I just kinda wish I could.",depression

824,t3_dkccvv,My life is just absolute shit.,"Problem 1: So tonight we were having spaghetti and chicken for dinner, and I’m not a big fan of eating meat but my parents don’t know that. So we were eating and my parents finished first. I ate a bowl of spaghetti and was full. I told them I was finished but my mom was forcing me to eat my chicken. It was a small bowl with a small amount in it, but I hated it. I ate a few small pieces but there were bits of onion and clumps of seasoning in small openings. (My mom is really good at cooking by I hate the seasoning and over cooked parts.) so yeah I ate a few more pieces and said I was finished again. There were two pieces left plus the small amount I picked off. My mom forced me to eat it. I ate a mall amount, this kept going on, but every time she yelled at me to eat more the less I wanted to. I eventually shoved a piece into my mouth and told her I was finished for the last time. She rolled her eyes and told me okay. I made sure every last bit went in the trash. While my sister finished about 20 minutes earlier by just eating some garlic bread and a bite of her spaghetti.

Problem 2: I’m not eating enough. I’m way too skinny and weak but I refuse to eat enough. I hate eating and I eat a little at school but some days I eat nothing at school and barely anything at the house. 

Problem 3: I’m being bullied a little. It’s not the whole cause because some stuff in the past and yeah. But these two guys in my health class will make comments if we pass in the calls like rolling their eyes, coughing so they make sure I KNOW they hate me. They also call me ‘ginger’ because of my hair color, which annoys me because I rarely even let my friends call me that. But in health they’ll say something like “oh look, she blah blah blah...” and when I make a comment in class..they say “stop commenting on everything oh my GOD!” And I’ll say “well you comment on everything I say so just ignore me and everything will be alright!” And they make it hard to even get through the day. Also one of them is in my home room and third period classes. 

Problem 4: I can’t escape my mind. I’ll think to my self stuff like “oh my god you’re so dumb and ugly just stop nobody cares for you he doesn’t like you you’re friends hate you. Just die go away fuck off you fucking bitch those guys hate you for good reasons.” And I’ll start tearing up and think back “shut up shut up SHUT UP SHUT THE FUCK UP PLEASE!” And I’m even tearing up typing this.

Problem 5: my emotions are going crazy. Like I’m fine now I just feel a little depressed but no more tears. I’ll be on the verge of crying then I’ll be perfectly fine. Sometimes I won’t even feel anything I’ll just be an emotionless zombie stuck with the terrible thoughts in my mind. At school I’m really happy except when I have health class then I feel super depressed and I always move my seat because one of the guys sit at my table. I hate this.

Problem 6: my life is just like the song NVM by Faith Marie. (If you don’t know the song listen to it it’s NVM by Faith Marie like I just said.) 

Problem 7: I can’t love my family. I feel no emotions to/for them sometimes. Rarely I’ll try and show the little affection I have towards my dad by showing him a funny meme or talking to him a little but nothing more. 

Problem 8: I like being at school more than being at my own house. When I go to school I’m away from my parents and sister and I can just be with my friends. Because my friends won’t hit me in the face if me and my sister get into an argument and I hit her. They won’t yell at me to eat my food when I’m feeling like shit. Sure, we mess around and fake fight but we don’t hurt each other too bad. My friends listen when I have a problem and offer to talk unlike my parents who won’t let me go to therapy because it costs too much money, or say I can talk to them at any time then forget about me, tell me I’m fine, and just ignore all my problems. And as you can see I have a lot. And whenever I bring this stuff up they push it away, tell me to shut up, and get mad at me.

Problem 9: I’m considering cutting to help with the pain. Nothing more. Just so I can forget about reality and escape my mind. I just want to slit my wrists so I can focus on that instead of everything else. I’d rather feel that pain than all this pain.

Problem 10: so a little while ago me and my online friend got into a fight. And we aren’t friends anymore. We’re both depressed and she helped me a lot. We only knew each other on roblox though, so it was extremely hard to see her in the same roblox server knowing I’m the reason we fought and I started the fight that made her more depressed. I know so because she said it. Not directly to me but I got the message. My heart aches every time I think of her/see her in the same server. I deleted my roleplay characters from our role plays but recovered them again because it was too painful having them gone then having them. Whenever I hear the song Gasoline by Halsey (her favorite song at the time) I think of her and it hurts me. Sometimes I play it just to torture myself. 

Sorry this was so long, but I’ve been helping, or, trying to help others and now I need help. Music calms me but I only listen to depressing songs. Help me fellow redditors, please.",depression

826,t3_dkc97c,I can’t live my life sober,"I’ve never been the type to self harm by way of cutting or something similar. I’ve been extremely suicidal (both passively and actively) in the past but...I’ve never felt the need to cut. 

For me, I self medicated with drugs. I’m a 25 year old female and I can’t even remember the last time I felt “okay.” I don’t remember how it happened exactly but I was feeling really low and was offered a painkiller (tramadol, which some would consider weak) and I swear....the world didn’t seem so grey anymore. I told myself I wouldn’t take them long term...i’m not the addictive type. 

Well shit...I was dead wrong. It’s been 7 years almost. And the thing is, I don’t take them every day cause I don’t have that kind of access to them. But I have been taking them on a semi-regularly basis for this amount of time. On days where I don’t have them, my body literally shuts down. I can’t get out of bed. I can barely move. Showering and brushing my teeth? Yeah right. So when I don’t have the pills, I look for anything I can put into my body to give me enough energy to get out of bed and get things done. Left over adderall, vyvanse, weed, liquor. Even taking too many prescription strength Tylenol when i’m desperate. Anything. It’s like I constantly need something in my system to keep me going. Does anybody understand me? I constantly need SOMETHING! I feel so alone. 

I’m not imagining this, I have been sober for a few weeks and in that time I was essentially a corpse. A dead thing. Got fired from a job because I didn’t leave my bed for those weeks. The fatigue is indescribable. 

The fatigue...god...this damn fatigue. I don’t care so much about the depression itself, it’s the crippling fatigue that drives me over the edge. I’m so tired of always being so tired. Antidepressants and therapy? Been there, done that. Nothing helps",depression

Its been a journey but my depression is no more.

&amp;#x200B;

   
Hey there, my name is Anthony.

I've always wanted to start a blog but was always too scared of rejection. I realize how silly that sounds...wanting to do something, having the drive to do something but, not doing it because you're scared about what they'll say. How are other people going to limit my potential without even knowing it themselves? Why do I have th ese thoughts that people will reject me even if people never reject me? I always thought depression was something make believe, or at least something that would never happen to me.

Analyzing conversations I've had previously in the day had become a popular habit of mine. I would obsess over conversations. Thoughts like ""Why did he said it like that"" or wondering if there were other motives to the conversation were very common, which is funny because I pick up on social queues fantastically. The anxious side of me isn't the most rational. 

Day after day I felt less and less like myself. I was beginning to get frustrated over every little thing that went wrong, and my stress levels were through the roof. I stopped hanging out with friends, I started pushing people away and I started to get depressed. I had to fix this.

One day while throwing a tantrum I had a thought...I never used to be like this, this isn't me. I didn't even feel like myself, I couldn't even tell you the last time that I felt like myself. It was like I had given someone the keys to my life and let them take over for a few years while I just sat in the passenger seat. There I was just living in autopilot. Depressed, I started to notice that my brain wasn't functioning as well anymore and I was forgetting what i was talking about mid sentence all the time. Stupidly, I turned to Nootropics, thinking it would fix my problem. I started taking L-Tyrosine(amino acid), L-theanine(amino acid), alpha gpc, and aniracetam. I felt happier, more energetic, and more like myself than I had in the previous year. I continued taking these for upwards of a month and then I started to notice another trait that was so unlike me. I was beginning to become extremely irritable. The smallest of things would set me off, making me a miserable person to be around. One night I was with my girlfriend and she asked me something while I was busy and I just freaked out, that was when I realized I needed to deal with my underlying issue and stop trying to bury it with this smart drug. I'm not saying that the Nootropics were the problem, but they were not helping fix the underlying issue.

I'm kind of against taking anti-depressants, anti-anxieties and even amphetamines for attention disorders for myself. I don't judge anyone who does, I believe the mind is like a muscle, and with the creation and following of good habits you can cultivate happiness, and calmness and mold the mind to your desire. Relevant thought I had today : you need to make happiness(cultivate), it's not going to come and find you.

Scouring the internet for anything that could ""fix"" me I stumbled acrossed the Wim Hof Method. The Wim Hof method is a breathing exercise that activates the autonomic nervous system. I tried the breathing method which is essentially hyperventilating for a minute, and holding your breathe as long as you can at the end. This is followed by ice water submersion or really cold showers for me. I did this method for a week or so and was feeling really energetic, more like myself than I had previously. Feeling a little bit better I continued doing the WHM but searched for other breathing exercises to try and experiment with. This is when I found pranayama which is the practice of breath control in yoga. From here I learned that I was even breathing like an anxious person(from my chest). I learned how to breathe with my diaphragm properly, and felt invigorated by these exercises. Day by day I could feel the depression disappearing, but the forgetting and the stumbling over words in front of people continued. This was a huge step for me, I was standing up taller, more confident, happy on the inside, but I still felt plagued.

Pranayama led me to the catalyst for my self improvement, mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness meditation has helped me focus on the present, control and get in touch with my emotions, clear my head, get rid of my depression, and get all of those negative thoughts out of my head. It started off slow, I started off counting my breaths until I looked deeper into it. When I first started I couldn't believe how little control I had over my mind, I didn't even know the Tasmanian devil lived inside my head. It got easier and easier and better and better. The effects from the meditation just seemed to keep building on each other. I laugh at myself when I used to get frustrated, I always have a stupid smile on my face, and most importantly I don't care what anyone else thinks. Without the depression I would have never went looking for meditation and now I can't imagine not meditating every day. In my opinion the happiness that you cultivate through meditation feels more like happiness than my preconceived notion of happiness.

I practiced solely mindfulness meditation for 8 months every day for a minimum of 30 minutes a day, sometimes twice. After reading about the synergy that is yoga, pranayama and meditation I adopted those into my routine as well. My current routine is 20 minutes asana(yoga), 10 minutes pranayama, 30 minutes or more of mindfulness. Although this takes an hour out of your day its worth it for how you feel the entirety of the day. Some people laugh when I tell them what I do, but I still share that I do it because I want to help people. The problem I find occurring most often is me not being able to explain how I feel after doing my practice, it's more of something you feel and can't be explained. If you're still reading this I hope I this post helped you or inspired you.

830,t3_dkc4dy,I feel like there was so much potential in my life thats just got ruined.,"I just need to talk my heart out this once.

Its pretty much what the headline states. I feel like My parents and my own stupitedy ruined my entire life already although im barely 15 years old. My childhood was perfect. I had the normal friends you would have. A normal school. In a normal village. Tze thing is i was diagnosed with ADHD and An iq of 135 early on and after that point onward my life kinda broke apart. I always told people how smart i am since that it what i thought i was which made a lot of people already hate me despite the fact i was only little. Also the doctor suggested that id get medication agains ADHD and special treatment for above average kids. But my mom refused both since she belives all mental disorders are just made up. So i was in this awkward spot where i would think of myself as smart while i was just being annoying most of the time. My life worsend when my dad nearly killed my mom in an agrument and we moved away without him. After lossing a lot of friends i just went truh groundschool (i live in germany school system is diffrent here) i got into 5th grade when my life really went downhill. Everybody just hated me for how akward i am. My brain slowly got dumber and my ADHD got worse since i didnt get proper treatment. My grades just git worse and i passed the year just barely. 6th grade was the biggest low point though. I  finally developed romantic feelings. Just not for girls. For guys. I realized im gay. Or as i later realzied bisexual. Since i was (and kinda am) still very young i didnt realize that i should probaly hide that fact since everybody is already weirded out by me. Dumb me decided to come out for some reason and since then barely anybidy liked me anymore. Now im 15. I Nearly cry myself to sleep every night. I have a therapist im too scared to tell the truth. I do drugs. I have some friends but im often to scared to meet them. I never have the courage to ask a cute gal or guy out and my grades are basically only E's and F's.

834,t3_dken9x,Lately I've been having mood swings that are getting worse.,"Hey all, I'm not sure if this is the correct place for this post but here goes. 

So I'm 21 and I'm not the person I used to be.  I've gone from an A and B student to a C and B student and I'm having mood swings.  Sometimes they last several days, sometimes my mood can change in a day.  

So a lot of times, I feel like crying or I feel sad, tired, guilty, worthless, etc.  I especially feel this way when I think about what's happened in the past few years, (e.g.. My dad leaving and my parents splitting up, financial difficulties that got better but lasted for a few years, e.t.c) then other days I feel different.  I wouldn't say better necessarily but I feel like i have more energy than I know what to do with, my brain won't shut up, (I almost can't understand the thoughts I'm having sometimes), I get super horny (sorry if that's TMI) and I can't sit still, I'm either anxious, irritable, or silly, but sometimes I have better focus so despite the silly or irritable mood, I get things done. 

 Sometimes I feel irritable but without the need to rush around and do stuff.  I just feel irritable along with wanting to cry and all that stuff.  I don't spend all day in bed but I'm not always productive either.  

I'm just concerned because like today, I woke up actually feeling kind of normal, but then before dinner, my mood just shifted into an irritable mood, I have no idea why and I snapped at my mom and it's been on my mind the whole evening and I feel awful for it.  I'm snapping more and more when I get an irritable mood swing and I'm worried that eventually, I'm gonna say something I regret.

Friend who is late for dinner every fortnight finally pushed it to the 50 min mark, so I left. They got angry and said that it was my choice to leave.  

Was meant to have half hour lunch  with co worker on Friday, they cancelled saying they were too busy, but then went had lunch with other people for an hour.  I had turned down two other lunch offers to be free for this catch up - found out later all 3 of us ate alone.  

Person I have been on two dates with from online dating site has stopped communicating and appeared on a new dating site.

Other person I have been only chatting with - I suggested we just meet up in person - they stopped chatting!

Making a few matches on dating site, but nobody will actually talk first - I therefore assume they are swiping a bunch of females and of their successful matches I am the least preferred to chat with. 

Ended up visiting a friend on Friday night (had a good time) but she has bumped me twice for other people, including once when I was already driving to meet her.

I am sick of being the lesser choice or fallback choice for people. Do you just reject all invites and stay lonely but preserve your self esteem or do you take the risk of accepting an invite and then this happens?  

With some of the people who do this to me I genuinely enjoy their company but I guess they don't enjoy mine as much, or see me as a last resort.

I have been trying to reach out to people to no avail. Texted my best friend miss you. She said miss you too. That was it no hey let’s catch up nothing. I’ve tried to do meetings with her but she can be flaky. 

I joined bumble BFF a year ago. I met a girl in my area that was originally from France. We became fast friends. Well she broke up with her boyfriend and moved back to France. I joined bumble BFF again have been chatting with a girl. She’s nice and we have shared interests but I’m always the one starting conversations. I would love to meet up sometimes but I just feel like the feeling isn’t mutual. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I overshare that could be seen as a turn off but I don’t want to come across as creepy.

Amazing company. Room for advancement. Everything. However one district manager kept promising me the world and delivering crap. This wednesday me and my manager (who has been eith this company for 12 years) were informed that the store is closing, and our positions were no longer needed.

We go to separate universities so I don’t see her as much as I’d like but we keep in touch.

I wish I could just vanish, literally, vanish from everyone's memories so that I wouldn't hurt anyone if I was gone, I wish there was a button that I could push to disappear, so that I don't hurt anyone when I'm gone. That's the only reason I'm still here, i don't want to hurt my family or friends. I know how much they love me and I know how awful it would be to them. I'm tired of everything, I really wish I could vanish from everyone's memories and just relax.

My mind is crumbling and I don't know what to do anymore, just handling it and acting like it's gonna be fine is not cutting it. I want to relax, I want to be happy. And it feels awful, because it's all about me. I feel so selfish when I think of those things but I just can't stop coming back to those same feelings.
I'm tired, I feel like everything is so shitty. 

I wish I could just click that button and vanish.
I'm tired, I'm way to young and yet I feel like I've lived long enough, It's been hell since I was a kid and always thought it just would go away with age, but it's always been a constant struggle with doing anything, I just did stuff because I knew I had to and that it was my responsibility. But I never had a purpose or the drive to do anything. 

I'm tired and I just want to vanish, without any trace of who I was. Imagine how cool that would be.
No one would cry, no one would miss me, I wouldn't be a bother anymore. I would just disappear as if I never existed. That's my true dream.

857,t3_dke3x0,Need some support,Just over a month ago now I tried to commit suicide and was at an all time high for depression. It was my first time (hopefully my last) trying to do something like that but I’ve had untreated and undiagnosed depression for a very very long time. Like way way before the typical time for people to start having depression. According to all the papers the hospital gave me to read on depression anyways. My family never thought of mental illness to be a serious thing before. My mom has depression too but she’s never even considered killing herself while for me the thought crosses my mind every month. Normally I can just push the thoughts away but this last time I couldn’t. I texted my best friend intending to say goodbye and shut my phone off cause I thought she was at work and wouldn’t see it for a few hours. She saw it right away and very quickly made me realize how selfish me killing myself would be to others. I have a few amazing friends. Maybe not in person but online. I know I need real life friends too but we move so often my anxiety never gets a chance to simmer down enough for me to go socialize before we’re off to the next place. Clearly the loneliness of that is part of what pushed me over the edge. But my bestie helped me realize I’m needed here and that it’s not the end for me yet. But still I think back and wonder why I decided to get help. I was so close to peace and quiet but yet here I am. I in no way want to go through it again but I can’t help but think about it. The peacefulness of death. The pitch black nothing that is death and how much easier life would be. I’m not happy. I’m not sad either. I don’t feel anything thanks to the meds they loaded onto me. And my mom just told me that because of this feeling of nothingness and me not having any will to do anything I normally like to do I’m just putting myself back into depression. As if I haven’t been depressed since I got back home? Nothing changed after my week in the hospital and psych ward. I was still depressed then I just initially had zest for things before the medications truly started working. I might be crazy tho. I’m sorry if this has brought anyone down I just need someone who understands me to talk to.,depression

It's hard to not show my exhaustion and despair to other people.. there's this moment I often get with people - often when we make eye contact - where they seem to see through my super friendly customer service facade and are just really put out.

I've tried toning it down a bit with the fake happiness but these moments seem to still happen so frequently. If I tried to be myself right now I would be just a heap of misery and no-one wants that. I don't want to be miserable.. but I am.. and try as I might it seems to be obvious to most people that something isn't quite right and I don't really want that either. 

It just makes me resentful towards myself if that makes sense? The way out of depression, I think, will be to make connections with people.. but that isn't looking likely right now.. Every time someone sees through me it just reinforces the notion that even when I try my best to make connections (no matter how small) there's something about me that puts up people's guards.. probably because I have my guard up a lot.. idk but it's doing my head in!

864,t3_dk9k1w,"Am I ""normal"" ?"," 

Hi everyone,

I’m making this post today to vent a little and to see if there are people like me and what they are doing about it.

I'm a 22 years old man and this is how anxiety impact my life.

**Social relations :**

Since I’m aware of my existence, i’ve always been an introvert. I was not good at making friends at school but i always had the chance to be in a group of friends, usually one of them came to talk to me and « invited » me in the group, i never did the first step.

That was the case until I left my country to study abroad 5 years ago, before that I didn’t know what loneliness meant, I really didn’t thought that I (my mental health) was so dependant on my family and friends.

As I do not live in my home country I am always suspicious of what people think of me, if they are making fun of my accent (happened a few times), if they really mean what they’re saying…etc.

I made 0 friends in 5 years, isn't that a record ?

And as if it wasn’t enough I recently started to stutter when talking (I think it’s because my loneliness kept me from practicing) , also I blush (like a tomatoo) randomly even in normal situations it’s like my body doesn’t want me to feel good . All of this reasons are making me more socially unfit so I just end up giving up on socializing and talking to people because i fear I might get humiliated.

**Relationships with girls :**

This will be short because it’s non-existent. I’ve never had a girlfriend or even a female friend, never had sex, never kissed,never hugged anyone. I only talked with one girl (that was not a cashier) in my entire life and she was the one that came towards me, she thought I was interested in her because I blushed when i talked to her but was very disapointed when she understood that I blushed with everyone else.

I don’t have a single clue as how to approach a girl, what to say ? What to do ? When ? I know that people just do it intuitively, but for me it’s impossible my anxiety won’t let me do it, without a plan I will just make a fool of myself.

Those kinds of question have been in my mind since I was a kid, I tought I would figure it out when I’d grow up, but I never did.

**Career/study :**

My social anxiety has greatly impacted my studies, it’s been 5 years of failing and changing programs at university.

I missed some of the classes because I can’t stand being alone all day, eating alone at lunch and everybody looking at me. The teachers didn’t help either they would often make fun of people and humiliate them when asking them something, so I choose to miss those classes too, because having that feeling of fear in my stomach and praying for the teacher not to choose me made me realize that I was not even focused on the lesson and was losing my time.

Honestly I never wanted to study and was not interested in anything, i always had very good grades before but when a choice had to be made I felt lost in all those possibilites, I was pushed by my parents to go abroad, they thought I would follow the steps of my older brother who has succeded and living a good life now, he is the complete opposite of me. I regret not saying what i felt at the moment.

So that’s pretty much it, ohh I almost forgot to mention I have an addiction to porn, weed and soon alcohol. That’s what help me forget my miserable life.

Thank you for reading (even if not everything), feel free to share your experiences and/or advices and I hope you have a nice day.",depression

872,t3_dk7wdy,Emotionally beating myself up,"Back in 2016 my mother went for keyhole surgery (something wrong with her gallbladder) everything seemed fined and she came home the next day. Two months later she started to get really ill and had been rushed to hospital many times but the doctors kept on passing it off as IBS (even tho I stated countless times she never suffered from it) months later she became a stick figure she was too scared to eat because she kept throwing it back up and I basically became her carer (I was 20yrs old) I found it extremely difficult to pull her up when she needed the bathroom or even when she needed a shower I called other family members but they just passed it off as a bug. One day when I came home from work I found her hunched over throwing up a massive amount called the ambulance to take her to the hospital I stayed there for what felt like an eternity only for the doctor to come out and told me that during the keyhole surgery 5 months before they poked a hole in her bowel and was suffering some blood poisoning I think so she needed emergency surgery to fix it. 

So after all that she was recovering well in the ICU ward then got moved to another ward till she was better I visited her on a daily basis as did my siblings and aunt but I went to see her and she looked sick again she was skinny frail and left in a hospital room with no nurses to check on her think it was some bug I then get a phonecall a month later from my sister to inform me my mother was in a coma I never saw her so still the doctor told us that if she goes they won't revive her but if she survived she wouldn't be able to walk on her own that night I cried my eyes out thinking how would I cope without her? She's like my best friend. She woke up three weeks later but her memory was a bit off couldn't remember what happened to her and had a couple of angry outbursts because all she wanted was to go home. One time she latched onto my arm crying begging me not to leave her there but what choice did I have? After that I couldn't see her again. My aunt called me to say since my mother couldn't look after her she asked me if I wanted to become her carer...I could barely look after her before all this happened how could I give her the care she needs? So when I said no my aunt went cold and instantly hung up the phone. The next thing I know she got put into a nursing home miles away.

Three years have passed I haven't seen my mother since I feel responsible for what happened keep thinking maybe if I insisted to the doctor that there was something wrong or maybe I should've agreed to look after her. I feel so goddamn guilty for the fact she'll never be able to do anything for herself I miss her so much there isn't a day that goes by that I don't break down in tears or wishing we could switch places.

Sorry for this post being so long too",depression
873,t3_dkdioo,why cant i shake this..,i had a decent day at work. got dinner with my friend yet here i am feeling overwhelmed with sadness. just wanting to cry. and i just think about how i always come back to this. no matter what i do. no matter what medicine i take and no matter what courses i take. then it begins to snowball. this is why i cannot be loved. why people stay in my life for so little of time and why i cant be with someone. i dont want to feel this way. i truly dont. i just wish i could fall asleep and never wake up. and i know it sounds dramatic but there isnt a day that goes by where i dont wish that i just wouldnt wake up anymore. ive felt this since grade school. im 25 now and i just feel it stronger. it keeps getting stronger..i hate how pathetic i am.,depression
874,t3_dk1ver,autism and suicide,"I know I can't take this for much longer but for the sake of peace, I keep going. 
Logically speaking, I should be dead, everything in my life has been leading to this point. Being autistic means that world is chaotic and scary - for us, there is no predictability whatsoever and our attempts to establish a sense of order are mocked or messed with. I feel a state of constant panic and fear: my throat is tight, my heart feels as though it will burn through my chest, my eyes twitch, I have to stim but my stimming is too loud and annoys everyone.

My mind never stops and I am always ruminating myself into depressive spirals. People mistake my weariness for standoffishness and my lack of facial expression for emptiness. People think that they have to take it upon themselves to bully me to make me feel something when I am already feeling everything to the greatest degree. When I melt down as a result, they just laugh at me. 

People force the concept of autistic people having no empathy when I do feel empathy is great amounts but it is easier for others to believe myths and misconceptions than somebody whose brain is part of a minority. Moreover, I rarely receive displays of empathy. I am bullied everywhere I go, and expected to accept people's toxic attitudes towards me.

I become suicidal when I think about how people must see me as an obstructive freak. I feel like a clumsy, ugly looming figure who nobody really wants around. I ruin photos and parties with my awkwardness. Social anxiety clouds all of my faculties and makes me want to hide in shame of being alive. Depression has zombified me to the point of me not being an active participant in life. I no longer enjoy the little things and that hurts. I simply don't enjoy life - my body has been filled with a black sludge that is so viscous and heavy that all I want to do is hang my head and stare at the ground.

I was born into a state of discomfort and have been triggered and traumatised into a state of despair and borderline apathy.",depression

Always on the outskirts, an incompatible loner. Don't see any hope. Feels I am sentenced to slowly implode. It feels awful. Many of you are in the same boat. I wish we could get out. Maybe there's just meant to be those who get the shit end of the stick. There's nothing.",depression
877,t3_dkapjn,my pointless rant,"been told that writing down how you feel can make you feel  better so fuck it, will give that a go. 
I’m going to be honest, I’ve been depressed as fuck for 5 years which I know isn’t a long time compared to other people here but it honestly feels like nothing has or will ever get better. Feel like I’m just wasting away mentally and physically. Like I honestly ruin everything with everyone I care about and wonder why I’m a pointless lonely mess. 

I ruined my last relationship due to how I’m feeling and it feels like I won’t be able to get over that, made me feel happy for once. My friends just hit me with the typical “think happy thoughts” or “stay positive” which honestly just makes me want to kill myself even more. Don’t see myself being here for much longer before I just jump off the bridge by my work. 

I’m apparently at the best years of my life but it’s just nothingness, feel numb 24/7 and would honestly just rather be dead. I just want to be loved and have someone who genuine cares in my life. But all I do is push people away who make an effort. My parents don’t even want to talk to me about how I’m feeling, honestly have no one to talk to . fed up of feeling like this and fed up of being alive.

But then out of nowhere, for no inexplicable reason, it's like my head told me ""okay, that's enough"" and then my mood sank again. Nothing bad happened, it's just one of those things that happens without explanation. It just is. Infact, it's probably because of a subconscious thing where your brain has a lot of bad thoughts, or something like that.

882,t3_dk6m0v,Crippling fatigue at all times...,"Hey guys,

A few years ago I suffered a pretty severe mental breakdown. I've always been a person who's tried to make things perfect, in an effort to get people to like me, but one day, when I had just a single night of bad sleep, I questioned my entire being in my ability to sleep, and kept an obsessive watch over it.

In essence, for over three years, I've seriously reduced my amount of quality sleep. This created a sort of anxiety based atomic bomb in my mind, since I was incredibly sleep deprived for an extremely long period of time. Having gone through therapy, and taking SSRIs, although I feel much better than I did three years ago, I still suffer every single day from an unbelievable and unbearable fatigue. It's ruined my life really.. I can't enjoy anything because of it, and I've tried everything from pills, drugs, to exercise.. And I still feel like absolute garbage during the day. 

It's a shame because now I'm essentially gauging my life from before the breakdown, and after, it's as if I'm blocked off from a form of consciousness/wakefulness that I used to have and really, really enjoy.

Anybody have any suggestions to cure or get rid of this, I'm at the end of my ropes...",depression
883,t3_dk7kye,Wondering again why I shouldnt kill myself,"Death is terrifying but inevitable. And it cures life, which to me is purely a horrorshow. I don't beleive in happiness, I don't beleive that it gets better. Arthur Schopenhauer and the buddhists were right. Life swings like a pendulum between pain and boredom. Once some desperately desired goal is reached it is replaced with boredom and a desire to find something new. And the fuel for attaining goals is suffering. The feeling of lacking somehting that you desire. It is a scam set up by blind forces that shaped in such a way that the human organism seeks to replicate itself. Species continuation is what we are programmed for, not ""happiness"". There is no evolutionary incentive for happiness. This leads to stagnation. The delusional beleif in ""fleeting happiness"", pairs quite well with emotions like embarrasment and guilt to push us towards another empty goal that results in boredom and a yearning for something greater. And we reach the end of our lives haveing gained nothing, because gaining offers nothing to the species. Only the constant frenzied movements in the hopes of gaining something lead to perpetual and sensless ""progress"" which never benifits the individual. I should kill myself and become nothing. I have nothing better to do, and it will happen some day anyway, likely in a painful method such as heart attack, cancer, or wondering into the middle of the road due to alzeimers and getting run over. But I have the fruitless desire to persist in my existence, even though it is an impossible goal due to mortality. So I am totally fucked, and have no hope of being ""happy""",depression

887,t3_dkd860,The Joker movie resonated with me more than I expected it ever would. [POTENTIAL SPOILERS],"""Put on a happy face"".

That line resonated with me on such a deep level. Its how I feel on a daily basis. The scene where he is physically holding a smile then he releases and his face is full of pain...man, that hit me hard. Its one of my favourite movies I have ever seen because it touched me in a way a movie never has. I felt like it was made for me, like it was representing my struggles, because I too had an abusive start in life. Obviously, when he starts murdering people and shooting people to death, I didn't at all feel connected to that, but the detachment he felt from society, the way his mental illness was a stigma, and the way he was just trying to make people happy when inside he was suffering and crying out for love and help....man. What a great movie.

It is one of the most important movies ever made, and a true work of art.

It’s like when I get lonely, I get almost resentful, so I just keep to myself so I don’t act like an idiot to people who haven’t done anything wrong.

My friends have joked around saying “You’re ugly” and other stuff like that... But one time she said “(Name) you are a beautiful person and don’t let anyone say anything else.” She makes me love myself when I don’t.

Im tired of thinking these things over and over again. I want the thoughts to stop. Im feeling sick just thinking about it.

Ive started cutting again recently, but my girlfriend hasn’t noticed yet because almost every time I’m near her I wear a jacket.
She makes me so happy. I constantly think out her. She keeps me up at night. Im head over heels for her, I don’t want our relationship to end. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

She doesn’t know about my depression, and she’ll probably never will, whenever I’m around I cant help but smile. I want to tell her what I’m feeling and my depression, but I fear she’ll just brush it off and say “You’re happy around me, right? You don’t have depression.”.

Nevertheless, college has frankly kicked my ass. I feel burnt out, unmotivated, and frustrated because I can’t find a way to get my sense of purpose and desire for success back. I know I’m blessed. I am so thankful for it, too. I know I’m in a wonderful place and I have the opportunity to do great things.

Negative thoughts are gone and my wife notices I'm more positive now. She says it's a night and day difference and I can actually be myself. Thinking about suicide is like thinking about an apple; it means nothing to me anymore. I feel increasing more confident now as well. My mind is more active overall and I have energy.

Before this, it was constant thoughts of suicide every night. Just visualizing a gun to my head and pulling the trigger over and over imaging my head exploading for no reason. The never ending feeling of wanting to end it all and disappear, even when everything is going great. I've been hospitalized twice in 2013/2014 for suicide attempts. So the feeling of major depression is nothing new and I've had issues with it for 10 years.  

I was on previous medications such as Seroquel and Lithium but it made me feel numb rather than happy so I just lived with that for years since it was better than nothing.

After my doctor did the Genomind test (DNA swab test) it gave us a list of medications that should work with me. There were some I dispised such as ProZac and Paxil because of side effects, but we eventually came across two I've never tried and that is..

LamoTRIgine 50MG (25mg twice daily)
Venlafaxine 50MG 

So that's my experience and what is working well for me. Not suggesting medications for everyone or anything like that because everyone is different.

But I had to do it. There’s that inner voice that keeps pushing you towards some unknown goal. With every mile marker passed, with every town I drove through, I kept telling myself I had to keep going. Ultimately I knew nothing waited for me, but I wasn’t ready to stop. 

Eventually though, I did. I pulled off to the shoulder in the middle of nowhere, shut off my car, and just sat listening to the water hit my windshield. 

And in that moment, I felt alone. As if my soul finally took a deep breath. Some unknown tension being lifted from my shoulders. I breathed, I reflected on my failures, my life. I just took it all in.

I got a DUI at the beginning of 2017 (which you would think would be a wakeup call to reassess my drinking habits but apparently not, the only thing that really changed is I make sure not to drink and drive). I'm a loser and a failure. I'm unloveable. Most of my friends are engaged or married. Not me. I have a friend with benefits (and using the word ""friend"" very loosely since he often puts me down and berates me) who treats me like crap and I put up with it because I don't deserve any better. Last night I went to his place after we had been out at a bar. The night actually started off well, we were having a lot of fun, but then I ended up blacking out because that's what I always do. I'm not sure what happened but I must've done something to piss him off. I woke up in my own bed after I ubered home (absolutely no memory of this) to a couple of texts from him saying I'm a disaster and have serious mental health issues and I'm not ever invited back (should be mentioned he was pretty drunk too and I'm reasonably certain he has a bit of a drinking problem himself). Great.

I don't understand what went wrong with me. It's not like I'm from a broken home. I have nice, loving parents and neither one of my sisters has the types of issues I do.

I will waste entire days trying to decide what I want to do. Even something like choosing a video game will take hours and usually end with me not deciding and going to sleep.

I will spend HOURS scrolling through Reddit and cannot get myself to stop, even though there is so much more to do in life.

I find cooking to be an insurmountable chore and will order out often because it's easier. I'm overweight - not terribly - but unhappily, but just can't fix it.

Chasing my goals has lead me to leave my home state and friends and to live in a new city alone. I have not made many friends here and I spend 90% of my time alone. The rest is in class. I find all my interactions with people to be painfully awkward and I just want to run away from it all.

I tried to get back into running, but hurt myself pretty quickly. Exercise has dwindled since. 

I find myself telling me that this is just all laziness, but if I compare that to what I've done in life, lazy doesn't sound like me. It still seems like I am.

I don't want to talk to doctors about it, I'm scared of the impact it could have on my future career. I also do not drink or do any kind of drugs...ever. 

I find myself ""seeing life differently"" than most but as soon as I say that I instantly barrage myself with thoughts of how egotistical that sounds and how I'm not unique. But then I see everyone doing things like parties, drinking, going out to events, everyone liking certain things, and I just don't do much of any of that - so I'm in a weird limbo of not fitting in but hating myself because I know I'm not ""unique""

I daydream a lot, I dream about being tough, being cool, desirable, pretty and appreciated by others. I want to have a purpose a reason to live. 
I know I can turn these things into reality but obstacles keep stopping me, but most importantly I keep stopping myself.
I am in so much pain, I keep crying, i can't stop crying. I have no one in this world and I'm not exaggerating,  it's a fact, I can't think of anyone who loves me. It's empty all day, I'm all by myself.
Since my parents are abusive, I want to move out and make something out of myself, but all of this is effecting my grades, I need A's to get into my dream uni but it all seems impossible. The exams are in 8 months. I wont kill myself because I know I'll be called a coward. My parents might feel guilty but nothing would change then.

I've recently been hit by another depression fog for the first time in about 6 years. I mean it never really went away, not completely. I thought moving out of my parents house had done the trick. It did and it didn't. 

In the past 5 years I have gotten married, found a purposeful job and move up a little in the pay scale. We have a mortgage and a plan for the future and hobbies that are both seperate to us and conjoined for us. 

Works been pretty stressful the past few months, my dad's illness is getting worse and I have managed to rack up about 4 grand's worth of debt on my 'emergency' credit card. 

I have been battling every day for the past few months to stop this fog from settling in and I've realised today that I have already lost. 

I constantly feel like I need to cry but I can't. I'm sleeping more than my back can handle. My head is constantly in pain. My eating has practically stopped...I can go all day before realising I haven't actually eaten anything more than maybe a mint. 

I'm not suicidal but I keep looking at my husband and thinking he should leave or I should leave because he deserves better. 

My housework skills have not been used in well over 2 weeks. My house is an absolute bomb site. Piles of washing waiting to be folded and put away. Projects half started and left; tools lying around everywhere. 

And now; my husband is working away, I have the off work. I have the house to myself with only a couple of plans during the week. The state of the house is stressing me out but I just can't find the energy to do anything. As soon as I stand up to get something done; I look at everything I have to do and just frump back on the sofa and wrap up.

It’s just a solo type deal.

Well today I went to do one small task of installing a windshield banner that I had to get a replacement for as the first one arrived ripped. The banner came from Canada, so it took a few weeks to receive each one. The moment I began I peeling the backing off, a letter ripped and it just made me feel like everything around me is just collapsing like pulling a jenga brick from a tower. 


All I can think about is how meaningless everything really is as our time here is as limited as the next animal. Why do I even try? I put forth my best effort and life just seems to shit all over me, the only time I’m happy anymore is the occasion that I’m not sober, and if I had a new job while in uni, Id probably be blowing my money on weed to keep myself high and numb my depression. I have less than 5 friends and maybe a couple that really give a shit about me but at the same time would easily live their lives without me.

Albeit Ive made progress but its minimal. 



I’m so cripplingly lonely and the only thing I feel like keeping me from ending it is my parents, but even in my depressive episodes they do nothing but talk down to me as if I’m doing something wrong, so why do I care so much about the feelings of those so apathetic to me?",depression

960,t3_dkqpk3,I REALLY don’t like being in photos.,"So my partner and I just wrapped up a really incredible trip with his parents, my in-laws. We had a wonderful time.

That being said: I suffer from a deep, long-running, and very painful hatred of the way I look in photos. Thanks to this, and a mother in law who tends to barrel into things without “reading the room”, I am laying here in our hotel room now feeling awful, and I’m sick of it.

I’ve found that sometimes looking in a mirror is okay, but as soon as I see myself in a picture, my self confidence is shattered. I’m not obese by any means, but I’m heavier than I should be. I feel like “mirror”-me and “photo”-me look like two different people. The “photo”-me looking terrible. Also, I feel like I have to have my “flaws” covered 24/7. This means long pants, loose shirts with sleeves, big glasses to hide my face, nothing low cut, etc. All of these combined have made me avoid cameras at nearly any cost. I even took a photography class in college, to get better at taking pictures, so I would have the excuse to ALWAYS be behind the camera. The hilarious gif of the one cartoon guy bobbing and weaving comically to avoid something is literally me around people taking pictures!

I realized early on that when I’m around our family, it is impossible to avoid all photos. My solution for this for the last couple of years was to tell my spouse that I don’t want to see the pictures taken with me in them. He knows this, rolls with it, offers words of love, compliments, and encouragement whenever possible. He’s the bee’s knees, and I’m lucky to have him.

His mom on the other hand, is not as accommodating. My father in law has the same photo-dodging tendencies, so she thinks it’s just me being silly/unreasonable, like him. This afternoon she decided she wanted to share all the pictures that she took of us from the trip. My partner just looked at me nervously as he knows how I am about it. I asked if she could please send them to my partner’s phone... NOPE. I immediately received about 35 photos via text. She just smiled and walked out of the room. The self loathing kicked in immediately in spades. I felt very ugly just seeing the pictures. Curled into the fetal position on the floor, tried to distract myself with Reddit, but I can’t sleep now. My head is just full of awful, hateful criticisms, and I’m so tired.

My MIL didn’t do it to be mean. I understand that she’s a nice lady who just wants pictures of her family. I feel like this is just another episode caused my by own issues, and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m so tired of the self-hatred. I’m working on losing weight, that’s the first step, but I know a lot of the work needs to be done with my own mental body image issues. I don’t even know where to start.

Does anyone else deal with this? Have any advice? I don’t want to hate the way I look anymore. It’s exhausting, and I feel terrible.

But I need to tell her about my paranoia that has been happening for almost 6 months. Since June I’ve just had a fear that everyone I love (including my pets) are going to die and I’ll be alone forever. I can pinpoint almost exactly when it started. I just don’t know how to open up to my mom about it so I can get some help. I cry almost every night hysterically over it. The thoughts I have feel so real that I actually sit there and bawl my eyes out. And I slam my head on things or punch my head in the midst of this.

964,t3_dkvjle,I feel like I’m losing control of my body and mind and I’m scared,"My anxiety and panic attacks started when I was 19. I’m a control freak and I think my anxiety started by smoking too much weed and having panic attacks.I’ve always been kind of obsessive and my anxiety is always in relation to my body. I can be a hypochondriac at times but I think more than anything I’m scared of being sick or embarrassing myself in public. Sometimes I get this sense of doom out of nowhere and it makes me nauseous which feeds my fear. Sometimes I go without eating out of fear of food poisoning but I know eating right makes me feel better so I  force it down. I took 75mg Effexor for a year when I was 19 and it was great. It cured my anxiety and I tapered off fine with no withdrawal. My anxiety was still there but became much more manageable. Fast forward 10 years and I decide to try ecstasy at a party (about three months ago).It was awesome. Within a week of trying it I start having crippling anxiety and my panic attacks are back in full force. I thought it would get better with time but it seems to be getting worse. I have a really hard time in situations where I can’t leave like when I’m in the classroom or giving a presentation. The fear results in panic attacks and IBS. Sometimes it’s so bad I can’t leave the house and it feels like I’m under a constant adrenaline rush. My therapist recommended I try EMDR therapy for trauma but I’m not sure if it will work and I don’t think I can afford it.   I decided to try going back on 37mg Effexor and the first day was great.

967,t3_dktwsm,"Constant anxiety about things being ""just so"", making lists, etc...","Good evening! Going to try to keep this short.

As a teenager, I was diagnosed with anxiety, GAD, panic disorder, bipolar depression, and OCD. I treated it with drugs and alcohol for years. I now have 2.5 years clean and sober and am amazed at how much happier I am. I also take Seroquel each night (200mg) to curb my mania that always creeps up as the sun goes down. I do not take benzos anymore.

When I was a child, I had cleanliness OCD. I would shower again if someone touched me who I thought was ""dirty"". My family had a spotless house, but there were certain doorknobs and pieces of furniture that I wouldn't touch. I gradually grew out of this type of manifestation.

My years of using drugs made my anxiety both better and worse, because all I cared about was changing the way I felt through substances.

Now that I am sober, I feel more emotionally stable and mature than I have my whole life. However, I have been struggling with different manifestations of anxiety. I am not worried about germs or diseases (I used also used to stay up all night on WebMD). Now, it is more of a list-making, purging, and having things ""just so"" type of anxiety. I'm not even that much of a ""neat freak"", but I spend hours making lists and hyperfocusing on organizing parts of my house/work/car/phone/etc. 

I am also a ""memory hoarder"". For example, if I walk downtown and pass a cafe that I went to in college, my brain will not move on until I have cataloged every bar or cafe that I went to during a certain year, and what I did there. I am constantly taking pictures instead of enjoying the moment. I am terrified of not remembering something. I write EVERYTHING down and organize it or I feel like I have lost something important.

In addition, I work at a medical facility that is heavy on documentation. I feel like I waste so much time checking my work over and over again when I could be bonding with our clients,

I have the frequent need to update and organize these lists that I make. Having them gives me a false sense of accomplishment AND a false sense of impending doom, like if I don't re-pot my plants and organize my sock drawer and write this thank-you note TODAY, then I have failed.

This is all very strange and specific, and my husband is loving and understanding, but when he asks me ""are you making your lists again?"" it makes me feel sad, like I am missing precious moments that I could be spending with him, or reading, or soaking in the bath, or laughing. I hold onto thoughts and memories so tightly that it feels like sand in my hands, slipping out faster and faster.

I know that our office has a few piles of clothes and stacks of mementos that need to be put away. I know that I need to finish that knitting project. But the bills are paid and the apartment is clean. I cannot seem to prioritize. This nagging feeling of ""finish the tasks!!!"" keep me from actually doing things to form memories and have experiences.

I hope someone here understands.

Thursday night I had, by far, the most horrible panic attack of my life. I got dental fillings that day and for some reason the feeling of my face being numb sent me spiraling into a fit of utter panic, where my body started shaking uncontrollably and I felt sick to my stomach. I thought that it would pass, but sure enough 8 hours later, I was still shaking uncontrollably.

Freaked out, I went to the ER but it was a 5 hour wait so I eventually went home. Took NyQuil to fall asleep, slept for 4 hours, woke up and immediately started shaking again and couldn’t even think about eating. Went to the urgent care, they gave me Zofran for the nausea and sent me on my way. Still shaking, I went to my doctor, who prescribed me Ativan. I went home, vomited 4 times, then took the Ativan and went to sleep.

When I woke up, I was still shaking and panicked as hell. Not knowing what to do, I went back to the ER. When I eventually got seen, the doctor there basically told me this was a really awful case of anxiety and to take the Ativan regularly until I can start CBT and start taking regular anti-anxiety meds. I took Ativan yesterday, eventually calmed down a bit and could start eating, but knocked out around 8PM. Now I’m awake and the shaking came back a bit and I don’t feel like myself. I’m just so, so terrified that for the rest of my life, I’m either going to be shaking, or I’m going to have to take Ativan.

I want my life back. I want to go back before I got those stupid fillings. I want to feel normal again, I truly, sincerely feel like I’ll never be normal again.",Anxiety

I took anti-depressants for the first time back in August and it turns out I get VERY bad Serotonin Syndrome from SSRIs.\* I have cycled through several, and now am on to trying SNRIs. The one I tried had fewer instant side effects, but had one bad lingering one: I couldn't focus on anything or make myself *do* anything the entire day I was on it.

So at this point I'm left wondering... Is there any medical hope for me here? My doctor is a GP and seems bewildered. I don't have access to any other docs or specialists. Even the pharmacists were just like ""huh weird, here's your new pills."" Furthering the problem, I'm so busy that I don't have enough hours off in a row, let alone days, to just spend a day lost to the fog of one of these and then the three or four days after it takes me to recover back to normal brain function.

Right now I'm looking at just taking Zoloft at a very, very small dose (because I really liked how I felt about 22 hours into the 24) and it seems that the more I take it, the less the reaction gets. But I still have strange side effects, particularly the low sodium thing. Which seems...bad.

So I guess I'm asking...has this happened to anyone else? What did you do? What are the potential long-term consequences of taking an SSRI medication I'm basically allergic to? I don't want to blind or have a stroke or something.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

\* If you want to know: I took half the lowest dose of Zoloft and within five minutes I was flat on my back basically unable to breathe without conscious effort.

If I sit still long enough this is when things feel weird, I feel pretty much just connected or one with my surroundings. 

Also when I stand still or am walking it feels like I’m going to lose my balance even though I am in perfect balance. 

I also have this odd lightheaded feeling in the back of my head 

Also I have gotten visual sensations of dissociation like my body just looks odd or I don’t associate with it. I mean I have tried a few dissociative drugs like dxm and nitrous a long time ago and the things I feel are honestly similar to the effects of these drugs. 

Also I might add that I have been sober for the past three weeks and the last drug I used was marijuana so I don’t think there’s anyway drugs could contribute to this. 

Obviously you can’t diagnose me but if anyone has experienced depersonalization from intense stress and anxiety and if these symptoms sound similar it would be much appreciated insight.

Basically my life has just caved in in the last few months. I was working at the four seasons in Canada making good money but not enjoying my job, as I am a qualified primary school teacher. So I quit my job and decided to move back to England to become a teacher again. That's where things started getting even worse. I flew back on my mum's 60th birthday to surprise her and after talking we agreed I'd move in with her while school was still in summer holidays for free while I did all of her housework/garden work etc. for her.

So, i arranged an interview with my old supply firm for working as a supply/cover/temp teacher and was told I needed to get a police check from Canada as I have been out of the country for over 6 months. That's fine, so I look into it and it's not as straight forward as it seems. The supply firm where not actually able to tell me which police check they needed, only that they needed one, which wasn't much help. Then after lots of emails and phone calls I find out that to get Canadian police check outside the UK you are required to get your fingerprints taken at a police station and have the process done manually which can take up to 120 days. I knew I couldn't afford to not work for that long so as a precautionary measure I signed up for unemployment benefits. That went super well too as I applied 1 day under a month since I had been back and you apparently have to be in the country for a month before your first appointment. They failed to tell me that. So I was unable to get a job teaching, unable to get benefits and unable to get other jobs because my CV is full of teaching and they think i'll leave them for a teaching job...which I wouldn't tell them as I want a job and money but obviously I would.

Finally I bite the  bullet and just decide to use the last of my overdraft to fly to Canada and get my police check done. It took me 20 minutes in a RCMP station and cost me nothing and they didn't even need my prints. Just 2 forms of I.D. and a signature. I'm almost certain I could've done it in England with how easy it was but no-one or nothing has offered me an easy way to get it apart from being in Canada.

So now I am back in England, in my 30s living with my mum, no money, no income, constantly battling the will to get out of bed as my life is a joke. All I want is my own shitty little place that is mine and a dog to hug when times are tough.

I'm sorry for venting but i'm not well at the moment. Going back to the doctors next week to see how I can keep on my anti d's whilst not being able to pay for them or i'll be even more fucked I reckon. At least now I can handle the lows even if they are most of the time.

A couple of Wikipedia articles and reasoning got me sorted. It's not a disorder.. it's who I am. I like doing things by myself, I am more focused when I'm alone, I think better when in solitude and yet I was chasing this dream after years of media consumption that the only way to live is by being social or talking all the time in general etc.

I am relatively new to Reddit and wanted to say hello! 

I wondered if there are many people here who suffer with health anxiety? While I know there are many extremes with it, I just wanted to tell a bit of my story and reach out to anyone else going through this

I just want to start this by saying my mother has Münchhausen Syndrome and I feel this has a part to place in my health anxiety.

My health anxiety started all of a sudden one night when I woke up in the middle of the night and convinced myself I had AIDS. I woke up my husband convinced I was dying of AIDS and had passed this onto him. I was hysterical and told him that i had basically sentenced him to death and also myself. I managed to get a blood test which came back negative as my husband had told me it would. I thought this was the end of my anxiety but little did I know it was just the start. 

Since then I have convinced myself I have had the following : 

Breast cancer
Cervical cancer
Brain tumour
Bowel cancer
Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
Thyroid cancer
And my ongoing anxiety... pancreatic cancer 

Pancreatic cancer is my major fear. I have had numerous tests and ultrasound scans because I’ve been so convinced I’ve had it. The success rate of pancreatic cancer is one of the lowest in cancers.... this is why my brain has chosen this for my anxiety. 

I have mentioned my mothers issue because I now see a correlation between them. Growing up my mother constantly checked me for lumps and bumps. She was neurotic that I was going to get meningitis. She made my live a misery in some aspects.

The anxiety I have with health is so horrific that at times I’ve woken up and wished I had died in the night as I can’t handle the constant fear. Nothing is more ironic than wishing you were dead because you have a fear of a medical condition in case you die!

1005,t3_dksc04,"I'm creating an app, and wouldn't mind some advice","Gday all,

I saw a stat a few days ago that put me on my arse: 56% increase in youth suicide over the last 20 years? Fuck me. 

So, we're a team of coders and marketers and I head it up. We talked about this, and we all agree we want to do something about this if at all possible.

Our idea would be to create an app that allows people to book sessions with actual trained Counsellors, and the live sessions could be delivered in the app via chat only, audio + chat, or full-fat video + chat. 

First question: Does this sound like something you would use, and what would make this ""better"" as an experience for a person seeking help?

So far, nothing hugely ground-breaking, I know BUT we want to be able to make it so there's proper clinical notes taken and there's always a 24/7 availability of Counsellors that can be called upon for helping those in need - so it's not just a glorified ""Zoom"" or ""Skype"" service that's a pretty crappy experience for all concerned.

Now we also know this costs a decent chunk to run, so whilst we want to make it accessible, the sad truth is that it needs to be at least breaking even and this is our next question:

If we got a reputable company to help sponsor this, would that be way too /r/HailCorporate you think? There's no way on gods earth they'd have any access at \*ALL\* to \*ANY\* personal client data - that is never going to happen, and I know my Team and I would cement that into Terms &amp; Conditions - we have built GDPR software for companies, for example. We value privacy and we're not doing this to turn a profit, remember.

Or, you think it would be better to get (say) a CBD company onboard for better optics rather than a more ""traditional"" company? Would that ""feel"" more palatable to people, you think?

Finally, the Counsellors themselves; I think we could get them onboard on a volunteer basis PROVIDING they've been screened as bona fide qualified Counsellors AND there's a simple way for them to be scheduled ""under the bonnet"" so it's never a chore or an arseache for them to deliver the services to booked people.

I dunno - I really want to help be part of the solution as youth suicide has touched a few of us in our Team, but we also don't want to be perceived as ""cashing in"" on misery - feels icky, you know? 

Appreciate your time reading this, and doubly appreciate any feedback you got on getting this off the ground. We think the service could be brilliant for young people, but we also want to look after (say) Veterans and others in different age groups as part of the same app.

Cheers all,

 I experienced some of the worst stomach pain in my life (I have digestive issues, and see a specialist for this) not too long ago. I was paralyzed with pain, and twitching on the floor. The people who were there with me at the time considered calling 911. The pain subsided eventually after an incredibly difficult night.

In a weird way, this pain helped me mentally. I had been dealing with anxiety and suicidal thoughts previous to this. But after that night, I felt so grateful for not having to be in that amount of pain, and having a functioning body, that I was filled with a sense of immense gratefulness the next day. I got up, did homework, took breaks to relax and read a lot, and enjoyed every thing that I did. I felt... so contented and happy for having a shelter, a family, a heating system (I get cold ok!!). 

I am now going to try to remember that time the next time these awful thoughts come in. Maybe, for some people, this will help you too.... sorry if it doesn't, this is just something that I thought I would try to share.

1037,t3_dkqhyy,Constant Anxiety three weeks removed from a bad high,"Hi All,

Just wanted to reach out to this wonderful community that I've been reading about. Some backstory:

24 years old, never had a minute of anxiety in my life aside from nerves that stem from public speaking. About three weeks ago me and a friend overdid edibles. I had a horrible high and while I'm not sure if it was a panic attack, it was an overwhelming rush of fear and being trapped.

The next day I thought it would pass like a bad hangover, but it kept rebounding and eventually it became a snowball in the sense that I was anxious I was anxious and couldn't break that cycle. Every minute at work became a nightmare to get through because I was nervous I would just completely snap. Some symptoms include:

- constant anxiety
- loss of appetite
- timid voice
- tension in legs/jaw
- trouble sleeping through the night

All of these seem to pop up in GAD but again as someone who never experienced anxiety before I'm not sure what to think. There are certain things that knock it down a peg for temporary relief and I feel like I'm still living a normal life, but it's a lie as every moment feels like survival rather than living. Just wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar experience or could shed some light. 

Also I've read about so many wonderful supplements that can seriously help so if anyone has recommendations they would be wildly appreciated.",Anxiety

How do you introduce yourself and what do you all say when first meeting them. Also when and if someone asked what you do for fun or what your hobbies were what did you say. Because again i know anxiety can make it hard for people to go out and do things. And i feel like saying  watching tv, reading, fishing are all kinda boring and introverted answers. 

I wanna be able to go out maybe make friends with the new coworkers but idk how to come off as a fun person and that i'm open to going to the bar or something after work or hanging out.

1044,t3_dknoq7,I lost thousands of dollars yesterday in a scam because I let fear an anxiety completely take over. Struggling with forgiving myself today.,"This story involves manipulation/computer hacking/threats and could be triggering to some. I’m also on a throw away account because I’m pretty embarrassed by this situation.

Some backstory: I have GAD and likely PTSD from a few traumas I went through when I was younger. I’ve been working with a therapist for months and am doing EMDR treatment, but we have to go incredibly slow or else I’ll have panic attacks where I sometimes experience depersonalization/derealization and it’s terrifying. I am in a very vulnerable place as I am forcing my brain to remember these bad experiences so that I can reprocess them. I struggle with realizing what is actually a threat, and what is just my brain reacting as if I’m in a threatening situation, but I’ve been making progress.   
Yesterday I was a victim of scary hacking scam. I don’t want to go into too many details, but this person knew enough of my information to scare and manipulate me, and then take control of my computer (like moving my cursor, opening tabs, and monitoring who I was texting while trying to sort through the situation). Fear and anxiety completely took over me and I couldn’t figure out what was really a threat and what wasn’t. My husband was away and the guy kept telling me to stop texting my husband when I was trying to ask him what to do (he could see my texts). I was blackmailed into thinking I was either about to lose everything (every dime to my name was accessible to this guy at this point) or that my name (which the person kept repeating) was going to be linked to creating really horrible websites (I’m sure you can guess). Fear and anxiety completely took over and I was too afraid of the consequences of not doing what he asked, even though in hindsight, none of it made sense. I went into total panic/survival mode and was too scared to try to ask anyone for help because in the moment, I was convinced I was being watched/followed and that anyone around me could be in on it. I know there is no logic to that, but stress and anxiety disorders tend to erase logic sometimes. Long story short, I lost thousands of dollars before I was able to snap out of my panic/derealization and stop doing what this evil person was telling me to do. 

Now I’m trying to get through the shame and humiliation of reacting the way I did. I am not a naive person who falls for this stuff, but I just could not stop myself from being completely controlled by fear of my life being ruined by the situation I was in, and I didn’t know what to do to stop it, so I continued to let this guy manipulate me. I went into full on panic mode with zero control of it. I guess I’m just looking for ways to give myself forgiveness for what happened. I did call the police to file a report and got laughed at by the cop, which was very degrading. Any words of encouragement/support would be appreciated. Thank you.",Anxiety
1045,t3_dksbrn,How to deal with sleep problems?,"Hi,

I have been suffering from anxiety since many years now, and I am utilizing both medication and therapy. But the one thing I don't have under control is sleeping problems - I just have problems falling asleep, even if I am super exhausted from a  long day of work and work out.

For example, I would go to bed since I feel super tired, but the moment I lie down I'm completely awake and pondering things, sometimes spiraling into slight anxiety since I'm not distracting myself. This causes me to fall asleep way too early, and having a bad sleeping rythm  makes me feel bad and gives me concentration problems. But keeping a good schedule is nearly impossible for me since I can't reliably get to sleep at a certain time.

GAD is something I have had in the past, specifically five years ago was my last painful episode lasting several months. I recently finished grad school and have been offered a job across the states. Three days after I received the job offer I promptly sunk into the spiral of anxiety I had been blissfully away from for so long. It makes total sense why it happened, I've been neglecting my health, not exercising, and in a stressful and unhealthy job. I have been struggling to eat well, have obsessive thoughts and worries about everything, and feel hopeless sometimes. I recently switched my SSRI, began running regularly, got bloodwork done and have a clean bill of health, yet I am still on a rollercoaster of anxiety and struggle to see a way off before I have to move. I feel like I need to somehow build up my armor and gain some confidence before I actually move or it is going to be really tough. I fear dealing with anxiety through the move and after, and possibly not being able to cope in a completely new environment. I am going this week to visit the place I would be moving to for the first time, so while I am anxious about that too I hope that will at least help me rationalize some fears I have.

My question for you all is, have you moved and started a new job somewhere else while struggling with anxiety? How did you do it? From the moment the anxiety sunk in two months ago I feel like I shouldn't move in this state, yet the opportunity is truly great and it is too late to change my mind. The job is likely less stressful than where I work now, and even pays you to exercise every week. It sounds like a good move, yet my brain fails to see it that way. I have never moved out of my hometown and away from family either. Any advice is appreciated.",Anxiety

I barely go outside anymore because I'm scared of breathing the air. I know most of my friends eat normal food, take showers, walk outside a lot and are fine, but I can't get the general worry out of my head, I feel like every habit of modern society is slowly killing me, making me dumber, more sick, unhealthy bit by bit.

1057,t3_dko2is,Anxiety punched me in the face. Seemingly out of nowhere.,"Hello, all. 

A few months ago, a  young, seemingly healthy person in my community died while exercising. Around that same time, I was preparing for an exercise related event. I was about 4 weeks into my prep and, after learning of the previously mentioned death,  I began to experience an intense fear of dying while exercising. I was able to brush the feeling off for a few days and continue my training, but eventually my fear of dying while exercising turned into a fear of dying in my sleep. At that point, I began staying up as late as possible, avoiding sleep at all costs and going about my daily routine while exhausted. Soon after, I was at the gym training and I got really dizzy and short of breath. I thought, “this is it”! I tried to call my wife but I couldn’t reach her. I sat on the floor and eventually gained enough composure to shower and drive to work. When I work, I had a more intense experience while talking with my boss and I ended up going to the emergency room. While at the ER, the doc did an EKG and ran every type of blood work possible. She told me I was an otherwise healthy individual with great bloodwork. There was no concern about my heart and , although I would die one day, it wouldn’t be that day. I’ve since been back and forth to the doctors office, had more bloodwork done. Doc can’t find any issue. Nonetheless, at this point, I can’t run for more than ten seconds or walk up the stairs in my house without feeling dizzy. I’ve never struggled so much with anything. It’s hard to believe that there isn’t anything physically wrong when I feel like I’m going to die at any minute. I’ve heard that these experiences are not uncommon. I’ll see the doc week after next for a follow up . I plan to discuss possible medications. In the meantime, does anyone have any natural (non medication) tips for coping?

4 years into that prescription i was feeling so good, to the point that i thought i didn't need the zoloft anymore. i went cold turkey on the zoloft (stupid, i know) and stuck with wellbutrin. i began losing all the weight which, in turn, developed into a severe eating disorder with which i still struggle with. unfortunately, with the weight went all my confidence, passion, and socialization capability. i did not connect the dots between getting off that medication and the massive dip in my mental health until recently.

i think the zoloft is what really helped me in that regard, while the wellbutrin (which i'm still on) just keeps me from wanting to kill myself. i'm currently at a low in my life for social anxiety, and i desperately want back what being on an ssri gave me. i believe it helped enable my passion, creativity, etc.

due to my eating disorder and dysmorphia issues, my priorities are skewed. i'm *currently* at a healthy weight, but still unhappy with it, and trying to lose. i'm so, so scared of gaining back that weight even though i need the positive effects from zoloft at this point in my life. i'm desperate for happiness but scared shitless at the thought of weight gain. anyone have any ideas on how to combat the weight gain side effects that go along with ssri's? is there a way to avoid it completely? thank you ! &lt;3 (diagnosed w/ major depressive disorder and GAD, btw)",Anxiety

BUT my brain gets anxious over other things to take my mind off of what I’m really anxious about and seeing as I have nothing major to be anxious about right now, my brain has chosen my entire life to be the victim. 

I feel utterly claustrophobic about working full time for a year and it makes me feel sick. I crave some sort of adrenaline kick. It’s as if I’m longing to put myself in danger. Disclaimer: I WONT but it doesn’t stop my brain from thinking about it. I just don’t know how to handle it. I’m struggling a lot. Every evening I just fall into a pit of despair and anxiousness. I’m just struggling to cope and i just need to vent it somewhere. 

I just feel like I’m utterly losing my mind and I’m just finding it really really hard. Some kind words would do a lot right now as I can’t seem to shut off to sleep.

1071,t3_dkph4v,is my dad abusive?,"i’ll try to keep this short

i live with both my parents in a suburban neighborhood, with two dogs and a part time job. i am privileged and i know this sounds fucking stupid since i SHOULD have a good home life. but i live with depression, dysphoria and severe anxiety. i have a very increased sensitivity to loud noises, crowds and ESPECIALLY shouting, it can send me straight into a meltdown and can ruin my day, and usually my week. 

my dad is fully aware of this, and has caught me crying profusely multiple times after screaming at me. right now i’m hiding in my locked bathroom because i didn’t take the dogs out and had a shower. he’s hit the door really hard multiple times and is screaming. i don’t know what to do i feel like i’m just frozen and this is my only safe spot. i’m fucking terrified. 

usually what happens if i don’t have somewhere to hide is he will scream at me while i try to fix the problem, he will call me lazy and sensitive and that i need to do more around the house, and then once he goes away to cool down or something, i go into my room and cry for the next few hours, and usually every day for the next week. sometimes, he catches me and calms me down, and says he won’t do it again and that he understands my condition. 

but then he does it again. i really don’t feel safe living with him. and because of him, i’m really scared of men in general, and men yelling. 

is this abuse? manipulation? or is it just him misunderstanding me? or am i just being sensitive?",Anxiety
1072,t3_dkpg18,Anyone here with a food obsession?,"So during the past 3 years I’ve gained something around 30 kilograms. It’s been a depressing and stressful period for me (basically that’s my high school years, lol). I started medication for depression and OCD  around a year and a half ago and one of my medicines kinda made things worse as it would make my cravings stronger. Right now my BMI is around 34, I weight approx 95 kg. 

These days I’m constantly stressed and I eat enormous amounts of junky food as a sort of coping mechanism,  and this is also making things worse since I’m worried about my health. But it’s kind of getting out of control. I just stuff myself with food, even tho I don’t particularly feel like eating something or eating anything at all. 

I should be seeing a therapist and my psychiatrist agrees on that, but there’s no such possibility right now (small town etc).

1073,t3_dkpbx5,Walking at graduation,"So I’m currently enrolled in my last semester of undergrad - I’m graduating in December.

Anyway, my brother and parents keep pushing me telling me I should walk. My brother was saying how mom and dad gotta see at least one of their kids graduate, and I get that to an extent.

1076,t3_dkoyf2,"I suffer with anxiety, but it manifests in a weird way?","I've never really identified with any of the basic symptoms (excessive worrying, physical symptoms, restlessness etc) but I've recently come to accept that I do suffer with anxiety (not the emotion, the *thing*). I'd always been aware that I had some form of issues regarding it, but not to this extent. It's becoming quite clear to me that a lot of the mental issues I face are because of anxiety. 

I don't really get nervous. That's not a word I would use to describe what I feel. I do, however, struggle to share my opinion sometimes. I find it very difficult to bring up a new topic from silence. I look to those I respect to form my own opinions, and I'm very ashamed if my own opinion doesn't align with theirs. I've been working on it. 

It's a little weird, the whole confidence thing. I would describe myself as a rather confident person. I've never had issues with self-esteem or self-worth, and I think that's why I've had such problems figuring out what's up with me mentally. I think I'm funny, usually pleasurable to be around and I don't feel like I'm ugly. A little chubby but hey, I'm working on that. But sometimes I feel a little weird regarding myself. An example I can think of was in school the other day. I saw that a P.E. class had been using the classroom before us, and I couldn't help but think to myself, 'I wish I was the type of person that would pick P.E. as a GCSE option'. But that's never a thought, it's always a feeling. I guess me and my anxiety work on different levels of my brain. Me is the surface. Me, I know that I'm a good guy whose opinions are entirely valid, but the next level below doesn't know that, and that level's somewhat responsible for how I feel. 

I've heard say that having certain mental health problems is like having someone telling you that you're not worth anything, you're a bad person, etc. I don't identify with that at all. I just kinda feel like I'm not as interesting as some other people. I *feel* like it would be nice if I was funnier. 

I don't think my social situation helps me. I'm not a social outcast or anything, and I'd say I certainly have social skills. I'd like to think I can be quite charismatic. But I've always felt a bit lonely, I guess. I do have Asperger's (quick rant - this does **not** affect me as much as you probably think it does. A lot of the people in my life like to compartmentalise most of my behaviours into 'normal' and 'aspie'. I absolutely hate this. It just means that I think a little differently, not that I'm some stereotype. Honestly, I wish I never got a diagnosis. Anyway, I digress) and it used to affect me a lot. I was bullied rather heavily in primary school, the GP tested for caeliac and all sorts and came up with nothing, but it was just psychosomatic stomach aches. 

I've never been in the centre of a friendship group, just the one who follows. I'm not shy, but I'm never the one who's always talking. I find that most of my friends are all much chattier than me. But if you do get me on the right subject, I think I offer some good conversation. I'm friendly and non-confrontational, and well-liked. However, socialising has always just been a little weird for me. Not in the awkward, 'I don't know what to say' kind of way, but the 'I don't get invited out' kind of way. I've noticed that whenever somebody else in my friendship group asks to hang out, no matter where it is, it always happens and everybody who goes it hyped. But whenever I make plans, everyone's usually either ambivalent about going (despite having a good time if they do) or it just doesn't happen. Maybe I don't bring enough energy for people to get excited about it. I am a bit reserved. That hurts, though. When people message you the day before to tell you that something came up and they can't go. I usually go out in small enough groups that if one person flakes, then there's not really much point going. Maybe I've just got some sort of complex, I don't know. 

I don't know what this was. I need to talk to a therapist but it's so difficult. I've tried CAMHS and I understand that they're understaffed and underfunded but by god, what a failure of an organisation. I've tried asking my mum about going private but she either forgets and I feel awkward about asking for the 8th time, or the therapist can't take on any more patients. 

Every time I've tried to talk to a therapist (CAMHS), it's never gone right. They just don't say the right things for me. I guess I can't find a way to detach socialisation from the situation and I go into myself a bit. If I do manage to get a private therapist, I'll really try to say these things. I've got a lot on my mind.",Anxiety

Or you're home minding your own business and suddenly and immense flash blankets the sky and your whole surrounding city is vaporized by a nuclear explosion. Or a school shooter(s) back when I was in school. 

I just woke up from a nightmare of picking my girlfriend up from the airport and suddenly some dude started shooting an automatic-rifle about 40 feet behind us. He was blindly firing into the crowd. I panicked with my gf in the passenger seat and floored my car and ended up running over an innocent family of three. The dad went under the right side of the car and the mom and small daughter went under the middle. Then the gunman turned an fired at my fleeing car and hit a few rounds into the trunk, and because my car is currently empty the bullets ripped through it like butter. My girlfriend got hit in the stomach and started to bleed out. I was in panic trying to flee from the scene and scramble to get my phone while driving. And when I finally got my phone to call 911, the operator asked me where I was so they could send me and ambulance but I have just moved here and don't know the area so I just began to cry and scream, ""I don't know"". The dream was so real and terrifying, but I honestly thought it was real life for the whole duration. I could feel the shockwave through my whole body as the gunman fired his automatic rifle not far from me, and I could feel the shockwave shoot down my foot and into the break pedal of my car through my shoe. 


I just moved to a new area all on my own across the country and thousands of miles from any family or connections. From the safe and easy suburbs of the East coast USA to Los Angeles, literally the second biggest city in the states after NYC.

It just keeps repeating and repeating the thing I'm worried about until I get some reassurance. Then it goes away for a little while but comes back, repeating itself, until the problem is completely resolved. Like, one time I was so worried that I was pregnant because I threw up one morning. I couldn't do anything about it yet, couldn't take a test because my period wasn't due, but I just keep thinking about it. It was such a pointless thought to and I knew it. Then I would talk to people, they would reassure me that I was probably not pregnant considering I was taking birth control, and then I'd feel better for an while. But then the thoughts would just come back again. ""What are you going to do if you're pregnant?"", ""How will you pay for the hospital costs?"" ""Will you lose your job?"" ""How will you find a new job while pregnant?"". Just crazy repetitive thoughts that have no purpose. This continued until I got my period. So my question is, how do you cope?

I was hoping that we could discuss our specific diagnosis. Perhaps in doing so we can find more fine tuned support from our fellow redditors. Also, I think that by defining our illness, we can more effectively treat it.

I have very bad ADD and have also been diagnosed with ""Engulfment Anxiety"" by my therapist who is very good at his job. Engulfment Anxiety is the fear of being trapped in a relationship or job, and losing one's self as a result.

We've been taking this extra slow because he needs to know he can trust me, that I'm not going to mess with him the way his ex's have. He's been through a difficult divorce, been cheated on and in turn takes panic attacks and has severe anxiety.

At the start he would come over and we would chat for a while or we would just sit in the car and chat for hours on end. I understand this isn't typical dating but I love those nights where we would just spend time together, they're special and mean alot to me and I understood that's all he was able to do until he felt more comfortable, at that stage we would go for drives, walks or would go to each others houses watch movies etc etc..

Roll on a few months and I myself have alot of personal circumstances going on, I'm a single parent, two kids, a difficult family but I'm normally okay with it all, I can normally find some coping strategies that work and he was helping alot by just asking how my day was or talking about anything at all, anyway, I take a bit of a breakdown, push everyone away and I feel like I'm too much for him, I bring too much on him so I push him away. It hurts alot because I know what I'm doing but I can't help myself. I annoyed him, I was a rock and I ruined it.

We didn't speak for a good few weeks, I would text and try to keep in touch but he couldn't forgive me. Recently we have been chatting again, we decided to go for a drive this past weekend and just chill out, it went so well.

He informed me the next morning that he had a panic attack when I was driving, apologised for being wierd but I don't feel like he should have apologised.

I'll cancel plans just so I don't have to drive in the rain. Which is bad. It's something I am working on...I can now drive in my car to local places with not too much of an issue.

One scoffed and the others said nothing, which is fine I just walked on to get ready to drive. 

Two of my coworkers came into where I was getting ready, and said that one of them could drive for me. I was ecstatic and told them are you sure? Then said how thankful I was. I said that I still would go if needed obviously but they said it was fine. This was great news. I'm still working up to driving further away. It's something I'm working on with my therapist.

But after I had a bong toke of legal cannabis/marijuana (24/m in 🇨🇦) to help calm my anxiety from the coffee drank 6 hours prior, it actually did quite the opposite and made the effects worse for about 20 minutes or so of just straight anxiety.

1110,t3_dkkdoy,Christmas anxiety in October,"I’ve always copes ok with Christmas when it’s my own family. Myself and my now husband always spent Christmas Day apart with our respective families. We got married two years ago and decided we would alternate which family we would spend Christmas with. This was fine last year as we spent it with my family. But this year it’s with his. 

- Christmas dinner is stressful with them. Everything is put on the table and we help ourselves. This just completely stresses me out. My family knows I just want my food on my plate. I just can’t handle the whole ‘pass me this, pass me that’ back and forth and I kinda freak out that the food itself has been passed about. 

- They are very present/money orientated. For example, if the budget for each person is £50 we MUST spend £50 and it’s looked down upon if it’s clear you haven’t. I prefer just to get the person something I know they’ll like despite the cost instead of just spending the budget on crap. Money and saving makes me incredibly anxious so I try and keep costs down as much as I can. I feel I can’t do this with them.

- My MIL gets flustered at every thing. It makes everyone stressed. And it just makes me feel like my brain is going to explode.

- My brother in laws girlfriend is going to be there. Part of my anxiety stems from an eating disorder. She is very orientated about what she eats, how she ‘shouldn’t be eating this’, how she hates herself for missing one day of exercise. I constantly feel she’s judging me.

- My FIL likes to be the centre of attention. He has to always be speaking, showing off his presents, boasting how much he’s spent on my MIL. He insists we bring our dog, then gets annoyed with him, telling us to leave the room with him or sit somewhere else with him. It always feels like it’s HIS Christmas and everything has to be perfect for him, no one else matters. 

I’m now already anxious about Christmas and know I’ll just have an awful time. Basically, as harsh as it sounds, I just don’t want to spend Christmas with them. I want to be with my people, my food, my traditions. I just wanted a moan really but if anyone has any tips, I’d really appreciate it.",Anxiety

I have been speaking with a girl long distance and recently gotten serious with her now that we live closer together, before we talked I had a one night stand with a girl who is known to 'sleep around', this gave me HIV anxiety. I have not had symptoms and I got tested at 6 weeks and then again at 14 weeks (the latest test was a full medical for a Visa which included a HIV test). These tests were both negative, and i usually accept these results. However when I get closer to seeing her, my worries come back, i am scared the tests were wrong/inaccurate and i could pass it on to her.

1121,t3_dkj4t9,I feel overwhelmed,"I'll start my post by saying I'm not an English native, so forgive me for every mistakes I will make. 
I hope I'm in the right sub, I'm sorry if not. 

I don't know where to start so I'll just try to say what s on my mind !

I am a 29 girl. I never really liked myself. Sometimes I do, I find pride in what I do, in who I am, but it never really last for long and the majority of the time, I don't. 
I always knew I was anxious. It was always part of me so I never really thought about it. I know it sounds weird, but I kinda just lived with it like it was nothing.
Few month ago a friend of mine talked to me about social anxiety, and it hit me. 
I started paying more attention about my daily life. 
I like to be in social events, when I know the people here, and when I feel comfortable. Some people (friends, coworkers...)couldn't believe I was shy cause I like to talk, make jokes, laugh... , I send every signals of a really confident person. When I have a drink or two, I even like to talk to random people with no problem, I enjoy it. 

The problem is what happens after. The day after a social event or interaction (it can be anything, meeting, restaurant, party, discussion), I'm gonna start to slowly dissect every part of what happened, and thinking I was being a terrible person, embarrassing, not funny, mean, weird.. I end up every time thinking  everyone hates me. I'm gonna live again every bits of it, again and again and again, sometimes for hours, sometimes for weeks, even months. I never know how long it's gonna affect me, I feel like I have no control over it. And it does affect me A LOT. the day after I feel really depressed. It becomes an obsession, I try to ""make up"" to people for what I think happened. 
It's eating me. Any joy that I could have from an event is eclipsed but all the anxiety I feel after. 

I tried to brush these thoughts away, do something else, but nothing really works. I feel like I'm sticked in that circle and it affects my life so much... I worked on my anxiety, worked on myself and managed to deal with loads of stuffs, and find peace. But this is the thing I can't stop... 

So here is my question : if anyone experienced it, or is still experience it, do you have any advice on how to stop/ reduce it ?

It all started with a mild tremor in my hands and gradually it has developed into me experiencing a slight tremor feeling in my trunk on top of my hands constantly, as well as with some mild spasms in my face and around my lips at times.I should note that these feelings become much more exaggerated after a night of drinking or when I have drank too much caffeine. Does anyone else experience these feeling? I worry that it could be a sign of a neurological issue and a sign of something wrong with my nervous system or brain. I do suffer from a lot of generalised anxiety and depression and these symptoms of top of that have made it much worse. Could it be a sign of health anxiety? Thank you in advance!",Anxiety

1148,t3_dkf0c0,My story and how there is hope for all(trigger warning),"Hello everyone. I'll just jump right into it. I had never dealt with any form of mental illness. Sure I had acute anxiety in certain situations just like any other human, but I had no idea what people with mental illness truly went through. Hell, I used to think of them as weak minded, because I had so much control over my well being. Being really into the gym I had only known physical pain. A little over a year ago I had my wisdom teeth removed. I was not put under, but sedated. It was a shitty experience but I got through it. I waited in the pharmacy for my pain meds for an hour, I was in such pain and embarrassed by how I looked physically. I sped home to be able to take the pain meds and got pulled over, the officer was nice enough to let me go because of my conditions. The first day went about expected, heavily medicated and watching movies on the couch. The next night is what began my nightmare. I decided to have a cup of coffee at night time, which was usual for me. As I was laying on the couch my heart started to race out of nowhere, beyond what I had ever experienced. I felt like I was going to die, I wanted my girlfriend to call and ambulance but she insisted it was a panic attack. I then went into my backyard and paced up and down for hours, sometimes stopping to dry heave. I didn't get one minute of sleep that entire night, my heart would not let up. So I called an advice nurse in the morning and she thought it may have been a mixture of Norco + Caffeine and to let it run out of my system. That next night was the same, could not get to sleep. So I was pissed and drove myself to the ER. They took my vitals and looked at me stupid, my heart rate was fine. I ended up leaving and going home. For the next 6 months I would endure what I could only describe as a nightmare. Beyond panic disorder, I had OCD, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts, just about everything. I was in my own hell and I didn't know how to escape it. During the middle of it all my girlfriend of 5 years left me as well. I hit rock bottom, but because of my inner strength I fought it hard. I remember always being afraid of something. For a few days it would be that I was afraid I would sleep walk and get my gun out of my lock box and kill my girlfriend. Another thing was I felt a heart beat in my stomach and thought it was an aortic anuerysm. Of course I would go to the doctor and run tests and everything would be fine. I would google search everything and believe I had a disease or cancer or schizophrenia. I felt like shit every single day, sometimes I'd have flu symptoms from head to toe but I wasn't sick. I stopped going to the gym, I dropped 30 pounds. The only thing I did was work because that distracted me from what I was going through. After suffering for awhile I began to arm myself with knowledge and good habits to fight this. Positive self talk, journaling, and practicing CBT for all of my issues really helped me.  It took me 5 months to see a therapist and she told me everything I was doing was correct. Sometimes I would be lying down and this mental pain would flood my mind, I have never experienced an episode like that until then and it scared the shit out of me. Thoughts would flood my head, ""go get your gun and blow your brains out."" I never wanted to commit suicide so those thoughts greatly disturbed me. I still don't exactly know what set it all off to begin with, as I can't find much on the Norco and caffeine thing. I believed it was something I had to go through and though I suffered I never quit. Those of you who experience stuff like this, fight it like hell, do whatever you can. Panic disorder will trick your mind and body into feeling like death. Once you begin to get ahold of it it will take time for your body to come down from it. Develop good habits physically and mentally, don't let it take hold of you. If panic creeps in laugh at it, if panic creeps in tell it to come right in and make itself at home. Practice not responding to the fear, and the fear wont have any hold on you.

I have terrible driving anxiety. Usually I don't have a problem with short drives, it's the long ones alone that kill me. This past month I've been wanting/planning to go visit family out of state (5 hours away), but always chicken out at the last second.

I am currently feeling a surge of motivation to hop in the car and go see my family. It's currently 1:15 am where I am, so I'd arrive right when they wake up. Thankfully my sleep schedule has been a little backwards, so driving at night due while being sleep deprived wouldn't be an issue.

I really don't know, but I've read a few things and I'm pretty sure it is. But forreal this shit is scary. Like actually scary. It's like I'm in a dream when it hits. It's literally like what drugs do. The world changes, I can't focus, I can't think straight, I can't remember things. I feel like I've overall overcome depression, that shit was a whole other beast, but depression didn't scare me. I had thoughts of suicide and I was thinking about when I should do it even... But nothing is as scary as being so vividly stripped from reality, this shit is drugs man. It's drugs. It's a bad trip. A panic attack when I'm all alone in my room at 2 a.m. with this incredible feeling that Death is circling my head while I just rock back and forth and try to feel something has never scared me more. On god imma shoot the fuck outta anxiety's knee caps. I'll beat that bitch to the floor. I'm tired of going out with friends, coming back home and realizing I was in a mental box the whole time. Tired of not living life. I don't give a fuck if my life is shitty I can fix that, cause I find joy in my friends, in making music, making art, making money (ayee), in sex.

Maybe I'm just scared of entering that place again, and it's sort of like placebo, I think I'm there so everything seems like I am, but really I'm not???

A bit of backstory: I developed severe anxiety and depression two years ago after my dad passed away very suddenly. I sought help and my primary care doc prescribed fluoxetine and buspirone. After getting the dosage right, it worked wonders! I was on the meds until early this year when my doc and I decided it was time to get weened off them. I’ve felt generally okay for the most part after I stopped taking the meds. That is until September (last month) when my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. This triggered my anxiety and depression and they came back stronger than ever. My symptoms and overall sense of hopelessness were way more severe this time around. I wouldn’t say I was suicidal, but there were definitely days where I just wish I had never been born so that way I never had to experience sadness, loss, etc.

I reached out to my doc again and restarted my treatment. I’m not 100% yet but I’m noticing a difference already.

She's a young manager (couldn't be older than 24-25) and is kind of, well, bitchy, for lack of a better word. She seems annoyed when I ask questions, don't know where things are in my new store, or mess up in any way.

I got really, *really* anxious during the first shift I worked with my manager and kept spilling things, forgetting how to ring up simple items, etc. all because I was paralyzed with anxiety. I'm worried she'll see me as stupid or incompetent, and I felt like I needed to prove myself or something so badly that I kept messing up instead. I'm so anxious around authority figures that it hinders my ability to do a good job because I'm too busy worrying about what she must think of me than I am focused on my actual job.

She hasn't been very kind to me, which makes it worse. She's not mean, but she seems like a person who never grew out of her high-school immaturity. I know that's her issue and not mine, and it doesn't reflect how I am as a person but rather her. Still, I find myself constantly worrying if she likes me or not. I hate that I even care--but don't we all just wanted to be liked and appreciated?

He keeps asking me to help him or say something meaningful (not empty things like its going to be ok, etc.). I cant help. Im exhausted. I also have anxiety and depression of my own.

1195,t3_dka8o9,Advice wanted,"This is my first time posting to this sub-reddit, so please be gentle. I've been trying to deal with this on my own. I just realised I needed help, so here I am. All advice is welcomed.

It started in 2011, after I turned off the bathroom tap. Then it happened when I turned off the kitchen tap, then the laundry tap. I would doubt that I turned it off, so I would go back and wave my hand under the tap to make sure that it was turned off or turn it on a little bit, then off again. I would walk away, but the doubt would come back. I had images of the bathroom and kitchen flooding and thoughts of: 'What if the bathroom/kitchen flooded?', 'What if you didn't actually turn it off?'

Then it moved on to checking the floor whenever I dropped something, like a tiny piece of paper or a paperclip. I would pick up the object I dropped on the floor - I saw that I picked it up - but my brain wouldn't register that I actually picked it up. Immediately my thoughts would be: 'What if you didn't actually pick it up?', '(dropped a staple) what if someone or you stepped on it? What if you didn't actually pick it up? Check the floor again.' This resulted in me staring at the floor where the staple was to make sure it was empty.

If I turned off the light switch, I would have to turn it off and on again until it felt 'right'. Same thing with the doorknob and the taps.

Now, it's seeping into video games. I tried to play Pokemon Ultra Sun, but had to stop because I would pick up an item and immediately, my brain would be like: 'Did you pick up the item? Check again! Oh, you walked away from the area? Go back.' This would go on for hours. The next day, I would turn on the game and I would just stare at the spot where the item was, even though I knew I picked it up. If I tried to continue playing, I would doubt myself if I actually picked up the item at X location and I would have to go back and stare at the spot to make sure I had picked it up. Rinse and repeat.

It was really annoying and distressing, so I stopped playing. Even though I enjoyed video games, I can't play them anymore without having these thoughts for each game I tried to play.

I bought the new iPad mini 5 a few months ago to replace my iPad mini 4 (I sold the 4). But, even that isn't free from my thoughts. I would set it up and my brain would be like: 'You didn't set it up correctly, reset it' or 'you set it up wrong', or 'you mis-clicked something, better set it up again'.

I'm sick and tired of resetting, setting and checking all these things just so the anxiety would go away; but it always returns, either a few hours later (if I set up my iPad in the morning, I would have to erase everything and reset it again at night, just so it feels 'right'), the next day, the next few days, weeks or months later.

I've tried checking everything only once and then moving on, but I'd have anxiety from it all day. At night, I'd just give in to the compulsions just so the anxiety would go away.

I hate it.

What can I do to stop these thoughts? I've tried meditation, but it doesn't work for long.",Anxiety

Due to this, I eat very limited when I'm out the house, for example at school I will eat very little in fear of repeating what happened those years ago, except in a classroom full of people. Sometimes I sit in class and I just start feeling sick (possibly like anxiety but I'm not gonna confirm that because I'm not certain) which will put me off eating for ages. I literally start checking my lymph nodes in my neck to check if I'm ill while in class, which they are always fine - that's the point is has gotten to however.

I've had brain fog and it's been kind of hard at times to get my thoughts out into words. 

My emotions are dull. Stuff that would excite me barely does anything. Something that would make me sad won't do anything either. I don't exactly feel anxious right now (maybe the anxiety medication I've been taking for the past six weeks is finally working). 

While I don't feel anxious, part of me feels like I should get an MRI. I've gotten episodes of what I'm going through right now in the past, but never this severe. For an MRI, I wouldn't know who to ask, or how to put it. All of this started in May with a host of other issues, so it has to be SOMETHING (one eye seems darker than the other, growing lump on neck, severe anxiety, mood swings, headaches, occasional sweet smells, etc.). My vision was 20/20 a year ago but now it's 20/30.

I doubt a doctor would help me though. I've been to two doctors about a growing lump on my neck.

The reason for this post is I just want to get it out there and if you guys could share any kind of advice, stories or anything like that I feel it would be really beneficial to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

1 - So to be honest, I feel more anxious about the people at work rather than work itself, e.g. the thought of lunchtime - sitting with people I don't feel comfortable with and making small talk. 

2 - I HATE the thought of people listening to me when I am doing something, e.g. a phone call or talking to a customer. When I am alone, I smash these tasks. But when someone is around and I know they're listening all I think about is what they are thinking and that I need to impress them. 

3 - This may sound weird but I feel anxious about being inconsistent with my personality. Some days with my colleagues and manager I'm all chirpy and fun and feel like this is the real me. But then sometimes I feel tired and anxious and just can't be who I would like to be. It makes me come across as an uninterested, irritated  prick to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway today, I done some temp agency work promoting a company in London. There was only 4 of us and all we had to do was greet the public when they came over and give them freebies. It's taken me a long time to get the courage to get out there and work again but it was honestly brilliant. My managers were so genuine, they felt like friends and it felt like there was no pressure to impress. I'm proper proud of the small steps to be honest and looking to build on this. A full-time job right now seems unattainable but as well all know, you build a wall with one brick at a time.

The weird thing though is that although my anxiety hugely reduced, I found many things felt weird that I can no longer rely on. For example I get super anxious that I'm going to get fired, because of that my work is typically said to be great and its got me ahead at work. Or I get anxious about how my manager thinks of me, and I get that freak out feeling so I end up HAVING to complete work before the due date so I don't have problems with motivation.

1219,t3_dk765l,Just a glimpse of my life.,"  

Hi everyone,

I’m making this post today to vent a little and to see if there are people like me and what they are doing about it.

 I'm a 22 years old man and this is how anxiety impact my life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social relations :**

Since I’m aware of my existence, i’ve always been an introvert. I was not good at making friends at school but i always had the chance to be in a group of friends, usually one of them came to talk to me and « invited » me in the group, i never did the first step.

That was the case until I left my country to study abroad 5 years ago, before that I didn’t know what loneliness meant, I really didn’t thought that I (my mental health) was so dependant on my family and friends.

As I do not live in my home country I am always suspicious of what people think of me, if they are making fun of my accent (happened a few times), if they really mean what they’re saying…etc. 

I made 0 friends in 5 years, isn't that a record ?

And as if it wasn’t enough I recently started to stutter when talking (I think it’s because my loneliness kept me from practicing) , also I blush (like a tomatoo) randomly even in normal situations it’s like my body doesn’t want me to feel good . All of this reasons are making me more socially unfit so I just end up giving up on socializing and talking to people because i fear I might get humiliated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships with girls :**

This will be short because it’s non-existent. I’ve never had a girlfriend or even a female friend, never had sex, never kissed,never hugged anyone. I only talked with one girl (that was not a cashier) in my entire life and she was the one that came towards me, she thought I was interested in her because I blushed when i talked to her but was very disapointed when she understood that I blushed with everyone else.

I don’t have a single clue as how to approach a girl, what to say ? What to do ? When ? I know that people just do it intuitively, but for me it’s impossible my anxiety won’t let me do it, without a plan I will just make a fool of myself. 

Those kinds of question have been in my mind since I was a kid, I tought I would figure it out when I’d grow up, but I never did.

&amp;#x200B;

**Career/study :**

My social anxiety has greatly impacted my studies, it’s been 5 years of failing and changing programs at university.

 I missed some of the classes because I can’t stand being alone all day, eating alone at lunch and everybody looking at me. The teachers didn’t help either they would often make fun of people and humiliate them when asking them something, so I choose to miss those classes too, because  having that feeling of fear in my stomach and praying for the teacher not to choose me made me realize that I was not even focused on the lesson and was losing my time.

Honestly I never wanted to study and was not interested in anything, i always had very good grades before but when a choice had to be made I felt lost in all those possibilites, I was pushed by my parents to go abroad, they thought I would follow the steps of my older brother who has succeded and living a good life now, he is the complete opposite of me. I regret not saying what i felt at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

So that’s pretty much it, ohh I almost forgot to mention I have an addiction to porn, weed and soon alcohol. That’s what help me forget my miserable life.

1222,t3_dk3a4r,I had another panic attack but this time it felt amazing!,"I was sleep deprived and lying in bed unable to sleep, which is a known trigger for me, when I started feeling the tingles of a panic attack. I usually try to calm myself down and think of unrelated things. This time however I instead just really focused on the exact bodily feelings I was having. It was before my gut started twisting itself, and all I felt was tingling in my muscles.

I realized that at this point it actually felt quite amazing. Isn't this exactly how a powered up Dragon Ball character would feel? Any ghosts in the vicinity would be very intimidated as they see my body glowing with flames and lightning. I started feeling more and more invincible. No fear at this point, just bursting with energy. I felt amazing!

Obviously I couldn't sleep like this, so I got up and started searching about others who had this experience and apparently it's a thing. How the hell did I not know about how you can turn the pre-stage of a panic attack into an intense euphoric power rush? It makes sense when you think about it, it's just adrenaline after all.

I have no idea if I'll be able to control it this way in the future or in other situations, but I'm actually looking forward to the next time I can flex on those ghosts. No wonder people get addicted to thrill seeking.",Anxiety

So for the past month or so my therapist has been on maternity leave, she has a replacement that I can go to while she isn’t there but it’s too difficult to explain my entire life story to be replacement so I’ve just been waiting it out. My schools homecoming was this weekend and my closest friend knows I have social anxiety, and I didn’t end up going to the homecoming because last time I went and I ended up spiraling into a terrible panic attack in the bathroom. My friend was asking me why I didn’t go and it was really tough putting into words so I could really get a clear answer out, and then she told me that she doesn’t understand why I’m so afraid and said I only use my anxiety as an excuse, even though I never mention it to her because I know she won’t understand it. I’m making this post because I don’t have my therapist to ask about it and I’m note sure what else to do. Is it possible that anyone has ways to explain anxiety to someone that doesn’t have it??

1225,t3_dk6mov,Is This a Product of Anxiety?,"So the vast majority of my anxiety comes from perfectionism and manifests in social or academic situations where it's easy for me to compare myself to others.

Occasionally, when I'm in the company of a lot of other people all gathered around talking and sharing stories (family gatherings or smaller parties with friends), I get this awful, heavy, sinking feeling in my chest, like my lungs are sticking together and my sternum is melting. It's accompanied by derealization, depersonalization, and the sensation of needing to scream, just to unstick my lungs and let out the sudden surge of *feeling*. 

I've never been able to put my finger on this feeling, and I was wondering if anyone else can relate -- is this a product of my anxiety? Is it some form of panic attack?

1227,t3_dk4l1u,I am my own enemy while the universe conspires against me. Great.,"Currently 1:30 in the morning, contemplating why I’m alive. Great.
Let me get this straight: I am both anxious and suicidal. NOT a great combination. I am also a complete doormat, a HUGE self critic and basically (like the title says) my worst enemy.

Whenever I produce a piece of work, no matter how it actually turns out, I can always, ALWAYS find something wrong with it. If it ain’t fricking perfect, it ain’t worth it. This has caused many problems. 

The most prominent one is that I tend to get anxious about handing work in. What if it isn’t good enough? What if I forgot to do something? What if it was already due?! And as a result, I simply can’t hand it in at all.
You see, I’m seen as the ‘smart kid.’ (No, I’m not an egoistic jerk, I have proof from my peers). And let me tell you, it isn’t as great as others make it out to be. To keep it simple, here’s a list of the worst things about being the ‘smart kid.’

1. Everyone assumes that you know everything. This is probably the worst of all because this covers many of the other issues. People keep coming up to you, asking, ‘what’s the answer?’ ‘I need help!’ And I feel so damn bad when I can’t!

2. You can’t make mistakes. That’s right, if you’re the ‘smart kid,’ you have to be a fricking robot. And the worst thing about this is that people will make fun of you for getting things wrong. So my unhealthy perfectionist is born.

3. People use you as some fricking guidline. I know some of you are thinking, ‘You should be grateful, ya nasty!’ But this isn’t something to be grateful for. You want to be a genius? Go to OP! You want to know the meaning of life? Ask OP! You want to be a fricking angel! OP’s the one to beat! 
And it’s physically and mentally draining! My peers always mark themselves against me in everything; assessments, homework, literally anything that can be graded.

Y’know when I mentioned that I was suicidal? Yeah. Basically those tendencies, those urges to just give up can pop up at any given moment, but are at their strongest when I get something wrong. If I don’t meet my goal to be fricking perfection, might as well end it now.
Most of the time, I don’t want to die, I just want to disappear, be erased from existence. To escape the pressure, the pain. Is it too much to ask for?

Anyways, I’m sorry for wasting your time with my useless garbage. For depressing you. For telling you about my problems. For offending you. For triggering you. For being alive.",Anxiety

By 2 PM, I was exhausted. I knew I was in danger of falling asleep, so I changed into my interview clothes and sat down on the couch to look up coffee shops near the interview spot...and when I sat up, I had 16 missed calls and I had been asleep for 4 hours.

However at work I’ve been asked to speak about my work expectations for the team, and the idea of speaking to just a handful of people, even though I work closely with them individually every single day, is really triggering me. 

I KNOW it’s irrational, because I know these people very well and I know what I’m talking about when it comes to my job, but every time I think about speaking to a group, I start to have an anxiety attack. 

My supervisors know I struggle with anxiety, but I don’t talk about it much. I explained to them separately that I just don’t feel comfortable doing that... I’ve even brought up how I can set my expectations via written guidelines. They said they’d like that. So I guess I’m not speaking at the meeting, which is good- I’m glad they respected how I feel, but I feel like such a weak leader for feeling this way. How do you deal with this shame??

I finished application and friend stuff. Thinking finally I can relax.

One day later I'm still feeling this constant anxiety in my body. And it's scaring me a lot.

I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety, but I believe that it has been something I’ve suffered with in my life. When I was younger I used to not be able to leave the house without having to be sick beforehand. I recall having to excuse myself at a friends house even because I needed to be sick from feeling so anxious. But I grew out of that as I moved on from early teens and I don’t have much of an issue going places and being social anymore like I used to. 

I feel like I have had panic attacks before but they were all sort of minor with my breathing becoming really quick and having to take a few minutes to calm myself down. 

But last night was the worst I had ever felt. It came out of nowhere which was really scary but all of a sudden I just couldn’t breathe and my chest was really tight and painful, and I really thought I was going to die. A stranger had to help me and calm me down as I was on my own which I found a bit embarrassing, especially seeing as though it went on for a while. I couldn’t stop crying afterwards because of how scary it was, and even today I feel so anxious at the thought of it happening again and not knowing how to deal with it. 

So yeah. I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it, as I don’t really want to concern any of my loved ones as I am living away from home, and a family member suffers with anxiety already so I don’t want to add to that. And I guess I feel a bit silly as it just came out of nowhere and wasn’t seemingly triggered by anything",Anxiety
1259,t3_dk4e7e,"Is it just me or does my new family physician sound like a dangerous idiot? (I've scheduled another appointment both with a new family physician, and with a psychiatrist for medication management)","I have had anxiety/depression for about 8 years. I've primarily been on 3 meds. Mirtazipine, continuously throughout those 8 years. And then the generics for celexa and Ativan on and off. (i'll go a year or so using them, feel great for awhile, ween myself off one, then the other, and then maybe a year or so later it comes surging back and I go back on them.) Overall, the meds do a decent job of keeping the major symptoms at bay, but I've finally decided to actually get psychiatric counseling (and medication management), to truly nip this in the bud.

Anyways, on to my story, I'm currently taking all three again, and I take the Ativan at 0.5 or 1 mg (depending how anxious I am, I've been told it's ok to do 1 mg at a time when needed), twice a day. And I've been doing that for several months now. I know it is short lasting but it definitely helps with my breathing and I can feel it working within minutes of taking it.

So I was running short on Ativan and went to a new family physician (because I had recently moved), and he said two things to me. one made sense, the other sounded incredibly dangerous. First he suggested, tapering off the celexa and trying a different long term medicine more focused on anxiety. He said paxil. Ok, I'm willing to give that a try. THEN, he tells me to stop taking the Ativan and he's not going to prescribe me any more. I told him I don't even have enough left to properly ween myself off of it. he said it's not that kind of medicine, I can just stop it. I said every other doctor who has ever prescribed me this medicine would disagree. He said no, and refused to write me any more.

The very next day I went to a counselor at my work both for help regarding my anxiety and for a second opinion regarding what this doctor said to me. She suggested to go to a psychiatrist for medication management, and if I can't get in immediately, go to another doctor, because suddenly ceasing Ativan didn't sound right to her either. So within a day I made an appointment with a new family physician and a psychiatrist. My physician appointment is this coming Wednesday and i'm hoping to get a new prescription of Ativan to last me until my psychiatrist appointment which unfortunately isn't for a few weeks.

Can I get some feedback here? Am I right in doing this? Was this family physician out of his mind for telling me to cease taking Ativan after taking it daily for months? And also he wanted to simultaneously switch the celexa to paxil at the same time I would be abruptly halting the Ativan. He was changing two variables at once. This seems really bizarre and possibly even dangerous.

My situation is pretty unique and to make a long story short, I work more hours than stated on my contract and I am in charge of creating my own curriculum. On the one hand this is cool because I do get paid for the overtime and I have so much freedom with what I do, but on the other hand it is a little difficult because I’m not super experienced and I have zero guidance given to me. All of my students have varied levels and they’re all grouped together in the same classes which means I have to create a balance during my lessons so that everyone can benefit. I have felt completely burnt out before. This is my second and final year of my contract which I am secretly thankful for because I would never do this for a third year, as lucky as I may be to have this opportunity. 

I try my best but I am prone to making lots of mistakes, and I have before while teaching. Most of the students are nice but I have a group of older ones who clearly hate being in my class and think they’re smarter than me. So, I made an embarrassing translation mistake last week (I didn’t know at the time) and just now I realized the mistake I made and I feel this overwhelming sense of dread and like the air has been sucked out of me. I feel like such an impostor with this job sometimes, that maybe I am really too stupid for this, and the mean, less-forgiving older students aren’t helping this process.

What I mean by this is by getting the slightly bit frustrated or upset, I will being to tear up for whatever reason, being due to hormones or something, and if pressed further I will unravel into a sobbing mess. My mom in particularly can tell when I'm like this, my cracking voice is a dead giveaway, and likes to prevent me from distancing myself in order to regain composure, and prodding me until I am unable to respond due to being overwhelmed with emotion. Even in my mind I know that what is being discussed in inconsequential, I just can't help it. I've been this way ever since my parents would fight in front of me for extended lengths of time which I would believe to be the root cause of it. 

 Honestly, I can't blame her for doing it. I find it incredibly pathetic that I'm so emotional and can't properly get upset and talk back like a normal human being. 

On the plus side, this does't happen too often, as I like to disassociate myself to the present situation so I don't feel too strongly about anything; most of my friends would consider me an unemotional person. It would be much more convenient for me if I did not cry or feel such emotions at all.

1272,t3_djzzvn,Intrusive thoughts after father’s death. Tips? Mostly just venting...,"So unfortunately, my father lost his battle to stage IV lung cancer, diagnosed in June. He was originally diagnosed stage II last July, but underwent surgery, followed by chemo which made him cancer free for 4 months or so... until it came back. 

The last few months have been so stressful. I have seen my dad go from being dad, to an anxiety-filled shell of himself in a matter of 4 months. His appetite was poor, and he was literally anxious 24/7 the last few weeks of his life. My mom, brother, and I became his caretakers, something I never thought I would experience at 26 years old.

When he passed, while it was very devastating, it was also a relief. He wasn’t suffering anymore. But it was very hard to watch, sad thinking about how he felt, knowing he was leaving us, that he passed 5 days after his birthday, 4 days after mine... that he won’t get to see his granddaughter (my niece) grow up.

I’ve taken a few weeks off of work to help mom at the house, as well as be her support. I have been trying to take care of myself the best I can (gym, hygiene, food, etc).  I make sure to get out of the house and hang out with people every now and then.

But I am having these random intrusive thoughts lately. But then again, it’s only been a week. I haven’t cried about the whole thing yet, but seeing pictures of him feels really... strange. I was the most emotional when he was first diagnosed... He’s gone now, and I won’t talk to or see him again. 

I’ll think about things like, “I wonder how he felt the last few weeks of his life, just being confused most of the time, not knowing when he’s going to die, why he can’t do certain things himself anymore”. Or I’ll have a flashback of his last few hours where he’s struggling to breathe, doesn’t respond to our words anymore, just breathing....

Basically I think so much about how miserable and terrified he probably felt physically and mentally the last few months of his life, like he was in a horror movie but much much worse. I think about how my mom lost her husband that she was supposed to spend the rest of her life with. I think about the fact that my brother’s daughter isn’t going to have a grandpa.

TL:DR; Dad passed away last week of stage IV lung cancer, quickly after stage IV diagnosis within 4 months.

1279,t3_dk0ppm,[Trigger Warning] I had my first panic attack of Junior year,"*Background: I am an eleventh grade student at a Christian school that is a ministry of a church. We attend chapel every Wednesday in the Church's youth center.*

So a couple of weeks ago, it was chapel day. The church that runs my school uses its youth center for funerals on occasion, so we had to use another room as to not disturb those attending a funeral that day.

Flashback to a little November 2018: my grandmother died. Being a prominent Nigerian woman, my family had to make sure that all the funeral details were in order so she could have a proper burial. Fast forward to April 2019, after months of sitting in a morgue, it was time to bury my grandmother. Nigerian morgues aren't very good at preserving bodies, so by the time we viewed her on the day of her burial, she looked disfigured due to botched embalming. Right then and there, I began crying hysterically and had to excuse myself from the viewing. And that sight has forever scarred me from being able to calmly attend funerals. I've been invited to attend about two since then with my mom, and I had to turn them down because the final memory I have of my grandmother makes my heart race and causes me to dissociate.

Anyway, back to a couple of weeks ago, I was walking by the youth center where the aforementioned funeral was taking place. There were windows into the YC and although, I couldn't see much with the people standing in the way, I saw that the lid to the casket was open, signaling that the funeral was open-casket.

I've been fine whenever there was a funeral in the YC before because I rarely ever saw a casket or anything before, during, or after the service, or anything that triggered me. But that day, seeing the lid to the casket, it reminded me of the horrifying final sight I took of my grandmother, and I spiraled.  I began to hyperventilate and had to excuse myself to the bathroom where I experienced my first panic attack in almost six months. 

It's been about three weeks since then and I haven't experienced a PA in regards to funerals or my grandmother. My mother also said she won't make me go to funerals if I don't want to if going would trigger me. 

I guess I can be grateful that I'd gone almost six months without a panic attack and that it wasn't over my grades or my dad, but it sucks because I thought I was doing so much better, that I'd left PAs behind. 

Well, time to put one foot back in front of the other because I really don't intend on staying like this forever. It sucks, man.",Anxiety

If I keep up my grades I am eligible for a PhD scholarship, which will cover my uni fees and give me a decent income while I work on my doctorate. This is all I’ve ever really wanted to do. 

When I started my bachelor degree I was overwhelmed with anxiety and depression. The stress of exams and assignments drove me to constant panic attacks and I wasn’t eating. My mum noticed I was struggling and brought me a tiny black bunny to keep me company. He was the most beautiful companion I could have ever asked for. I named him Vince and I owe everything to that sweet little man. I suffer with narcolepsy as well, and every time I fell asleep on the floor he would run over to me and either lick my cheek or sit with me until I woke up. If I broke down or had a panic attack he would sit with me for hours on end and kiss my face as I cried. Nothing could calm me down like his sweet little nuzzles. 

He had a lot of health problems in the last few years. I swore I would do anything I could if there was a chance he could still live a happy pain free life. We made it through two big scares after many sleepless nights and thousands of dollars at the vet (literally the best money I have ever spent). And luckily I got another two amazing years with him, even if his head was a bit wonky. 

After six and a half wonderful years, Vince unexpectedly passed away in my arms two days ago. He made the most awful scream as I clutched him and ran to the car to rush to the vet and I realised he was gone. 

I am beyond broken at the moment. My final thesis is due in 6 days and even though I’m almost done, I just can’t think straight at the moment. I’m starting to panic again and I’m not sure if I can stay in control of it right now. I’m so scared I’m going to throw away everything I’ve worked for if I don’t get this finished on time. I’ve lost my best friend and the one who used to help me through these things and Don’t know what to do

Update:
Thank you to everyone for the overwhelming support. I wanted to write back to everyone individually but I have been far too busy writing, yayy.

 I absolutely love the idea of dedicating my thesis to Vince. I will definitely be doing this and have started writing a little dedication statement to honour just how amazing he was.

I went inside and grabbed a glass of water from the bar and went back outside to try settle my nerves.

They still happen, they still have that sudden impact on the thought process - that jolt, but the exercises that I've learned and the meds I take have been far more effective. For example, before I quit drinking I would have to fight through breathing and meditation exercises for almost an hour and even take a full dose of Xanax (1mg is what I'm prescribed) to curb an attack or deal with a tense situation. Now, when an event happens it doesn't take nearly as long to curb the effects and more often than not medication is not necessary. My doctor even lowered my dosage recently to see how I react, and so far, so good!

Granted, the first week was tough especially on my nerves, but it got easier. Not more than twenty minutes ago, I had the onset of a panic attack happen, and where before I would start my exercises and take a pill I was able to calm myself with three quick-in slow-out breaths and fifteen seconds of meditation, no pill.

I've also cut out smoking (38 months), caffeine (5 years), and improved my diet the last couple months. Things are definitely looking up!

For the curious, I haven't had a drink in over eight weeks. Yes, I do crave it now and again, but I don't desire it; I crave it less than someone would crave a pint of ice cream. No, I wasn't in any trouble with the law, my health (other than being overweight with blood test results not ideal for someone my age), finances, family, or friends; I voluntarily checked into a hospital to safely detox for five days. I don't see myself not having another drink for the rest of my life, but I also don't see myself going back to my old habits...one day at a time!",Anxiety
1294,t3_djz2qj,About to tackle one of my oldest anxiety habits and end it for the first time.,"I've peeled and picked at my nails till they bleed or were in pain since a child. It is embarassing and I paint my nails to help them look good but I'm in a new career now and I really want to stop and have pretty long nails or just simply be able to get a manicure.

I decided if I can stop doing it till something I want to pre order is released next year I can buy it as a reward for a sort of physical motivation.

1295,t3_djyyeu,Is this a normal anxiety attack?,"I had a panic attack that was very unusual, so much so that I reached out to emergency services because I thought I was having heart problems or about to go unconscious. Now I'm young, and I don't suspect to have any heart diseases, but the reason I was scared in this moment is because I have been having chest pain for the past couple weeks that was unusual to my common anxiety pains. I have pectus excavatum (funnel chest) and was concerned that this was getting worse in light of the symptoms, but I felt certain that it wasn't anxiety. My life is stressful but stable at this moment so that added to my thought process that I wasn't having bad anxiety. 

So the attack went like this: today my chest pain was getting worse. Right after work, I started getting more concerned about how bad it was getting so I start driving to a hospital on my way home. I didn't feel usual anxiety or buildup to an attack (usually I'll feel nauseous, sweaty, start breathing faster, have a higher heart rate, etc.). Instead, my breathing was more relaxed than usual and my heart rate was normal. Suddenly, I had a feeling as if something suddenly squeezed my chest, my heart rate shoots up suddenly and I feel like I'm ready to pass out. Directly after this, I still get these little ""bursts"" of having this feeling of doom. But I didn't hyperventilate until a couple minutes in, didn't have warning signs, it just happened out of nowhere. Now, I'm okay; the paramedics said my heart was working just fine (which gave me peace of mind on that) and that I had an anxiety attack. I believe that's what it was too, especially since I felt like crying and weakness afterward (which is usual of an attack for me). But I'm confused: I've never had an attack like this, unprompted. I know what it is now, but I would rather not have this again, it was one of the scariest moments of my life, especially on the road.

Has anyone ever had an attack like this, unprompted, without usual symptoms or triggers and without that ""pre-anxiety feeling"" you get before and attack? And is this normal? Nothing triggered me today, not thoughts and not driving on the road (I love driving). I've also had anxiety (diagnosed GAD) for 8 years, and although I've had really bad anxiety and panic attacks in the past (especially the past year), I've never had something like this. I'm currently untreated but I will be seeking treatment especially after today.",Anxiety

1303,t3_dk085d,I'm freaking out over being pregnant even though it's pretty much impossible,"Pretty much as the title says. Just to be clear, I know it's not allowed to asked for diagnosis, and I'm not doing that. I know it's pretty much impossible, but I can't stop spiraling.

My very supportive and loving bf is okay with having penetrative sex almost never because I usually tend to spiral and freak out about pregnancy. I haven't been pregnant once so far but I had periods a month late, persistent nausea for weeks, sore breasts, etc.

This month, we had sex 2 days before and 1 day after my period. Those are supposed to be totally safe. We don't use condoms bc I'm horrified they'll break as this has happened to me before. He never ejaculated anywhere near me and wouldn't lie about this since he's not a complete idiot.
This happened about 10 days ago. Since then, I've been feeling nauseous literally the whole time and had some pain in my ovaries. I haven't been able to eat more than a few crackers for 3 days. My hands and feet are constantly clammy, which has never happened to me before.
It's probably worth mentioning I've had milder nausea without sweating and other symptoms for about 2 weeks before any of this happened. 

When I went to see a doctor she said it was all in my head and gave me mild relaxing meds and told me to schedule a session with a psychiatrist. I did, and the next available one is near the end of November. I went to a gyno as well but made the mistake of omitting why I'm horrified and only mentioned ovary pain. She did an ultrasound and told me yet again I may have policystic ovaries, but mentioned nothing else. I later googled it and figured out she kinda can't see anything anyway until like week 4.

I can't live like this, I haven't eaten properly in over a week, I'm horrified and can't function. Does anyone have any advice or coping mechanisms or anything? Please help me.",Anxiety

I'm at least 90% sure these mistakes are because of that - I'm not stressed about the job at all, just stressed over having such a short time period to be finishing work in. Starting November I'll be there full-time, and I feel like I will have a better chance of not making these mistakes when I am not rushing through projects.  
However, I have found myself hyperfixating to the point of depressive episodes over these little mistakes. I leave the job around 12-1pm and I will be at home around 6pm still thinking about things and getting anxious and upset over it. The logical part of me wants to think that because I'm two weeks in, I'm still ""training"" and therefore shouldn't be taking it so hard, but the anxiety is telling me that these mistakes are putting my new job in jeopardy already and are contributing to self-deprecation and depression.

1309,t3_djzswq,"Chance to ask my crush out went wrong, and now I don't even know anymore ...","By the way, did I mention that it took a STUPID amount of guts to muster for this moment???

There's this girl I have talked to a little bit before (3 times), and I finally mustered up enough courage to come up to my crush and ask her if she wants to hang out. The problem is, it's quite  difficult to find or contact her because we don't go to the same classes and outside of class it's hard to locate her on campus. HOWEVER, I know that she attends an English class at a certain hour. Beyond that I don't have many other opportunities to see her.

So one day I wait till she walks out of class, and she walks up the stairs to another class that she'll be attending in a few minutes. Thinking I can snatch just half a minute to ask her out, I follow her up the stairs. I bump into her talking to another friend. She sees me and says, ""hello"" before continuing the conversation with friend. Not wanting to interrupt the conversation, I wait right next to her till she can be done. Well, it turned into TWO minutes, and it's very awkward for me to be standing around all doe-eyed, so I move off to the side a little more, looking over the balcony... feeling very very very awkward for waiting. 

Finally, she stops the conversation and starts moving towards the door to her class. Her class is starting and she's supposed to move along to not be late. I understood all that perfectly well. But I made it all this way, and since I was grappling at straws, I call out her name as a last resort to get her attention. 

Her didn't look back. She just continued on, ignoring me. 

I realize maybe I was stalling her. Dick move on my part. Worst case scenario, I felt like an absolute creep for standing around.  But at the same time, would it have hurt her to be polite and be all, ""we can talk later""? Or at least take just half a minute out of her time so I could ask her that very quick question? 

Great, now I'm feeling very embarrassed and self-conscious for looking like I'm too creepy or too clingy. Maybe she dislikes me now. Since I also have social anxiety, I couldn't stop throwing up ever since.",Anxiety

1311,t3_djzpgs,"My cat has to have surgery, and I know it will only help her - but after losing 5 pets in one year, I'm sick to my stomach that the worst could happen.","In July last year my 17 year old dog Maddie passed. One month later it was 18 yo cat Lucky. Four months later our new kitten Pabby. Two months ago 20 yo cat Rainbow. One month ago our new kitten Alex. All to natural, unpreventable causes. It was hard to see my childhood pets decide their times had come. Then to adopt a kitten to heal the hurt, only for him to have a genetic disease that killed him. And then *a second time* to another new kitten.

Now my 4 year old cat has to have surgery this Wednesday to remove a growth from her mouth, and su subsequently some teeth. They will test the growth for signs of disease or cancer. She has *severe* separation anxiety to the point that she rips her fur out to the point of bald spots, deep gashes, and bloody sores. And in a few days I have to leave her somewhere scary as she watches me walk away, as people will then jab her with needles and cut into her body, and she will wake up wondering why, *why.* It is then a possibility that I will be told she is sick.

1313,t3_djuodx,OCD &amp; Anxiety trigger: the detail oriented mind. How do you beat it? Discussion.,"Lately I feel like my biggest issue with anxiety is that it can make me detail-oriented. While this is something that makes me good at remembering things, or helps me at work (I work in patient care, so it's essential to document things with detail/accuracy). I find that it is also stressful socially. I tend to notice things that stand out, bother me, and this usually results in me bringing it up and regretting it later. People assume this is me coming across cocky, or as a know-it-all, but the truth is, it's more of a compulsion. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY. And to keep it to myself almost makes me paranoid or panic. But how do you explain this to someone who just thinks you want that control? (I mean, yes, that IS at the heart of the OCD mind, but only in the sense that you need release from the ""panic"" mentality of it. Not the ""I want to be in charge"" feeling.) Like I could care less about being right. It's more about the ""impending doom"".  


Does anyone else get this? How do you cope? How do you let your peers know your concerns without coming across like a jerk? I am constantly working on this, but I can never seem to get it quite right. Then a massive argument takes place, I get blamed, and usually just accept that because it's better than arguing with someone I love. (Yet this hurts A LOT and still leads to depression later.)

1331,t3_djs2yy,Is technology making us anxious? Has it had a negative impact on you in any way?,"So I've been using a smartwatch(Amazefit Bip Lite) for more than 2 yrs now and in the beginning it was very exciting to see my heart rate and all. I've been suffering from anxiety for some time now and it affected my health a lot too. I'm much better now and finally I've started cycling (basic exercises) to stay fit and today when I was cycling, literally my 1st day of cycling my smartwatch buzzes and tells me my heart rate is too high (146bpm) and I sort of panic. Thrice it buzzed and warned me about my heart rate and since then my anxiety has gone up! I could feel my blood pressure rise and it's still in that panic zone. Has this happened to anyone before? If yes, how did it affect you?
Not just this but has any kind of technology had some kind of a negative impact on your health instead of helping it?",Anxiety

1333,t3_djyg1o,Anxiety or Anaphylaxis? What a fun game!,"Hello, so I've had anxiety for 16 years now, no medication. I've been having trouble eating certain foods these past few weeks. It all started with some caramel ribbon ice cream. I was licking away when my throat started to burn and prickle. I drank an ishh-ton of water and the feeling went away after about 20 minutes, but the panic was REAL.


Fast forward to today. I'm eating a sandwich with my boss. We were having a working lunch, and I could feel my face and chest getting red. Whenever I have to discuss things with him to begin with, my face flushes. My cheeks turn red, my chest flares up.. the whole bit. This time my neck flushed too.


My breathing was fine until I *thought* I saw my bottom lip swelling. In hindsight I'm pretty sure it wasn't swelling, but after I ""saw"" it, I started getting heart palpitations, the flushing was more pronounced, it felt like my throat was closing off near my tonsils even though everything looked OK.


After lunch, I let my boss know that I was having trouble breathing and he recommended I drink looots of water, and that he would go get some Benadryl. I was chugging away but the feeling didn't subside. The flushing was going away, though. Rather than worry alone in the office, I joined him to go to the pharmacy.


He gave me the Benadryl, we called an ambulance just in case because my breathing was still troublesome, and they gave me MORE Benadryl and took me to the hospital. 
The doctor said that there was no common allergen between the sandwich and the ice cream, but he prescribed an epi-pen just in case and recommended I take Reactine for the next two weeks.


So far I have reacted to:

- Caramel ribbon ice cream

- Starbucks caramel frappuccino, no whip

- Meat pie made with a pillsbury crust

- Plain hamburger with lettuce and tomato on a bun

- Pork schnitzel sandwich with a salad and balsamic dressing


There are 0 ingredients that correlate to all of these. 0. I have been so terrified to eat anything these past few weeks. I can't keep living like this. Except I have gone through this before. A few times. In fact, this happens every few years around the same time (August to December). This time, was it anxiety? Was it a severe allergic reaction? Who knows! I'll have to schedule another appointment with an allergist again to find out. The last allergist I saw said it's just anxiety and never tested me.",Anxiety
1334,t3_djybfv,Need some encouragment to visit a psychologist,"First of all I apologize if there is there are threads like this. Maybe I am a egotistical but I feel like I need someone to respond to me. I feel like if someone make some time to respond to my call for help would already be somewhat encouraging.

To make a long story short: I was never a happy kid but around the age of 17 my life began to really plummet, and for the past 4 years I have done nothing but spend the days in my room or take walks in the forest. I am 25 btw. At this point of time I am taking a class  with distance learning and I have been doing preatty well, but the last week my anxiety has just been elevated to levels I have never felt before. There are some reasons behind it but there is no reason for me to state them. 

These past 10 days or so have delt with constant anxiety and panic attacks. I usually try to stay awake as much as I can, until I just can't stay awake any longer, just so that I don't have to face bed time. Whenever I am alone with my self things get really bad so I spend most of my time browsing the internet in a desperate search for any sort of distraction. My sleep schedule is completly off. Yesterday I went tot bed 10 am and woke up at 6 pm. Also let me tell you that I live in a nordic country and sleeping like this means 1 hour of day light.

My major problem at this point is that I can't take not being distracted wich affects my studying. Sitting down to read a book is a sure way to set myself up for a panic attack.. 

My mental state has taken everything form me, friends,work, social life, whatever happines I might have felt as a child, and now my ability to study.

Anyway I finally admit that I have a problem, and preatty much surrender to it. I can't deal with this shit by myself, it's impossible. So I am now facing the problem of actually meeting a psychologist. The thaught of just talking to someone scares me. I am completly repulsed by the thaught of sitting down and asking a man for help. Is there a way to chose the age and gender of the psychologist I want to meet? I feel like an elderly lady with some actuall empathy would be absolutely ideal for me. 

I really need a some encouraging words or something to help me take action. Has anyone been in my position? And did it help to get help?

1335,t3_djvqoq,Heart palpitations after eating?,"I've noticed after eating a good meal I have heart palpitations (hard thumps, fast heartbeat, can feel it up my throat). It takes awhile for my heart to calm down. I've got my heart checked out awhile back with a cardiologist and everything's normal. Anyone else going through same thing? And pinpointed out what can be the cause?",Anxiety
1336,t3_djy6p7,Need some advice on my heart anxiety,"I've been having health problems for 7 weeks now. I'm very young (19) and heard it takes decades for heart related issues to really develop. I don't have any of the risk factors like a family history, drug abuse, obesity, high blood pressure, so my primary doctor thinks it isn't heart related. He referred me to a cardiologist just to be sure who I'm currently waiting test results from.

My heart rate feels always elevated and I'm constantly checking it.  ( It'll be 80-90 when I'm sitting down, and then sometimes if I don't check it for a while and then check it, it will be in the 60s-70s. Then I'll re-check it and it will shoot up to the 80-90s. I get anxious when standing up, It will shoot up to the 90s-110s just from standing. I also have this constant sharp pain on the left side of my chest. It used to be only on my left side but now the pain will move to my right side as well. I sometimes get this flash of heat mostly in my arms and legs. Some nights when I'm on the verge of falling asleep I'll feel like I can't take another breath and instantly wake up. I don't know if I have shortness of breath I've never felt like I couldn't breathe but sometimes I'll become more aware of my breathing. I'll sometimes have this feeling of spasms inside my body, on occasion my arms or legs will move or spasms involuntarily. I don't feel like my heart is irregular but I will have these moments where I'll feel some sort of extra beat and instantly panic. When these do happen my heart rate doesn't instantly jump up past 100s and I don't feel a jolt of adrenaline as some people with arrhythmias have experienced.

I've taken a few heart and lung tests. (3 EKG/ECGs, a echocardiogram, blood work, d-dimer, chest x-ray) all normal. I'm awaiting the results from a Zio Patch (which is like a Holter monitor) I wore and a stress test I did 2 days ago.

After my echo my cardiologist said that my heart was structurally normal. He said that there is a possibility that I have a arrhythmia so he wanted me to wear the Zio patch but said that the results will probably be normal. I'm still waiting for the results.

The 2 times that I've gone to the emergency room (first time for heart and second time for lungs) I was told I'm fine. They recommended exercise and meditation.

When I was doing my stress test after I got off the treadmill. My heart rate wouldn't go down, I think it was stuck in the 120s-140s. The nurses said I couldn't leave until it reached 105, eventually it reached 115 and she said I could leave and was allowed to go home. I was very anxious that It didn't go down to 105. When I asked the nurse if there was anything abnormal she said that if she was really concerned she wouldn't of let me leave without a doctor looking at me. I was relieved and confused at the same time. During my stress test I felt no pains and was suprised so I'm hoping that this is all anxiety related

I'm also on Propranolol 20mg. My doctor prescribed me it 5 weeks ago after I called him saying how anxious my symptoms were making me. He said I can take it 3 times a day or when necessary. I've gone from taking it every other day to taking half of one once a day to taking an entire one every time I wake up. I'm thinking about taking 2, one for morning and one for night. I've heard how your heart can increase if you don't take it. I still feel chest pains while I'm using it but if my heart is racing it usually goes down to normal ranges. (sometimes it will still be in the 80-90s even after I took a tablet.)

I'm still having problems accepting that my problems are anxiety. They feel chronic and nonstop, I really need some advice on what to do. Should I talk to a therapist about my anxiety? My next appointment with my cardiologist is in 3 days where I will get my results from my stress test and Zio patch. I feel like my heart will fail or I'll have cardiac arrest before my appointment. The only time I feel safe is when I'm at a hospital or at the doctors.",Anxiety

1343,t3_djujcq,Dull stomach pains that seem to travel as the food moves? Am I crazy? Or is this something others with anxiety experience...?,"Long story short, I’m 26M and up until my 26th birthday (right when my I was kicked off my parents insurance) I had never felt ANY anxiety.. I’m not trying to brag, I’m simply laying the plot for my post. 

Days before my 26th birthday I started to feel this discomfort in my stomach each time I ate, about an hour after eating, and sometimes randomly throughout the day. It went on for a few days so I went to urgent care and was prescribed omeprazole for gastritis. Then, a couple days later I had my first panic attack (and what a joy that was). As someone who’d never had anxiety I thought I was having a stroke or heart attack and called 911. In a few minutes I was back to reality and not panicking.. then days after that my chest was always tight. And I wasn’t sure why (because I’d never had anxiety).. even once I knew what it was I had more worst panic attack for about 2 straight hours, the tightness in my chest lasted for about a week. After that I went back to my
Doctor and was put on fimotidine instead of omeprazole as I was convinced the omeprazole caused the anxiety attacks. 

Since then I’ve still had minor stomach discomfort, starting behind the lower left side of my rib cage and sometimes it feels like it’s moving with the food.. but never below my belly button. I’d lost about 20 pounds when the anxiety started and I’m now able to eat a little more than before, but the stomach discomfort still hangs around. It isn’t debilitating, it’s just annoying and then my mind starts to think the worst (cancer or something) which often leads to more stomach pain.. 

Does anyone else have a similar story? I feel better knowing I’m not alone and that others have gotten past this. I’ve cut out all spicy and acidic foods because I feel like the pains were an ulcer but at this point I feel like it could be due to anxiety.. who knows, but I’d like to know if anyone has had this and gotten past it, and if so HOW, because it’s really terrible. Also I’m pretty anti daily meds because I don’t want to become dependent or change my personality..",Anxiety

I cried tons last night because of that and had a terrible panic attack that ended in me hurting myself. Afterwards I felt guilty for the damage and I just...

Usually under a lot of pressure like this, I'd loose my composure and loose track of my thoughts. I was like that towards the beginning, but I still managed to pull through and stay coherent. I was making my breakfast and the topic of nutrition, cholesterol, science and diet came up. My dad thought that it was peculiar that I always tossed out the yolk out of the eggs. We both knew of the general consensus about cholesterol, that in high quantities it's harmful. He has the belief that brown eggs are more healthier than white eggs, I told him that it wasn't true. ""The color difference makes little difference, the contents are all still the same."" He insisted otherwise ""In nature, their are different colors because the contents are different, like brown rice and white rice."" I responded ""Those aren't the same things, we're talking about eggs right now."" We kept going back in fourth, and pretty much his argument and our area of disagreement was about science and personal experience. 

He kept saying that scientists decide what's true and what isn't true, and believe they know everything. He also said that because he digests brown eggs better than means they are healthier. I pointed out how he was mischaracterizing science, and also I said ""Just because you feel like it digests better, that doesn't mean it's any healthier, there could be something else going on there, but the contents are the same as a white egg."" Eventually he got angrier and angrier the more and more I explained why he was wrong. He kept repeating himself, and then started shouting when I showed disinterest in talking because he wasn't saying anything new. I kept insisting, let's agree to disagree, but he kept continuing getting angrier and angrier. He has conspiracy beliefs about how the FDA works. I have my issues with it also, but his are a complete cluster fuck. He's scientifically illiterate, and has tons of unfounded beliefs, and is an Alex Jones fan. So I'm not being egotistic when I say he didn't what the fuck he was talking about. The more and more I kept my cool and refuted what he said, the more he got angrier. I wasn't backing down because he can shout this time around. I'm seventeen, and I turn 18 soon, enough is enough. 

He's 57, and kept looking down on me because of my age, how immature can one be? Eventually, he decided to give up after we argued more in my bedroom, after arguing with me throughout the entire time I made my breakfast. It ended in me saying ""I disagree strongly."" He then finally decided to leave the bedroom after getting the last word, doesn't matter to me, because he knows he made a clown of himself by getting angry at a 17 year old for disagreeing with him. The amount of emotional immaturity over something so small is fucking hilarious to me. But it's okay, because my time is coming closer, one meal at a time.

I’m having trouble accepting touch or being intimate with my partner during a particularly long and horrible streak of anxiety. Please note I’m in therapy and just started taking 10mg of Celexa again, but I feel uncomfortable talking about sex with my therapist so here i am lol. Hoping someone may be able to give advice or even just validate. 

I’ve been with my partner for a little over three years now and we just moved in together about a month ago. I’ve been job hunting for about nine months now and am in a really anxiety inducing full time position currently so it’s fair to say my life has been pretty unstable for quite some time and my anxiety has been quite a rollercoaster. The issue I’m having is that my partner is very affectionate and wants to cuddle/kiss all the time and I cant reciprocate or even feel turned on enough to want to. I just want to be left alone.  I dont know where the shift took place because we used to be quite intimate with each other but it feels one sided now being that I’m no longer able to receive touch without spiraling. I’m only 23 and feel like everyone around me has a “normal” sex life and is able to just have sex without being anxious about it. This anxiety doesn’t stem so much from performance anxiety but more so anxiety to fulfill my partner’s needs. He hasnt pressured me in any way, but I’m applying pressure to myself, thus making me more anxious. Im sorry if this was a bit all over the place but I’m wondering if anyone has any tactics on how to calm down in intimate situations and not let your brain race at 50 miles a minute.

It’s been manifesting as paranoia and minor delusional thoughts. Basically, I’ve convinced myself that because I’ve been slipping into dissociation more and more and also having these intense panic inducing delusional thoughts that I’m developing schizophrenia. 
So I decided I needed to ask my dad if anyone in the family had been diagnosed before in the hopes I would put my mind at ease. I explained to him why I was asking and why it was making me paranoid and he replied as a “joke” 
“Well people who think they’re schizophrenic are usually schizophrenic aren’t they?”

I ocassionally get sharp pains in my chest left or right side and then instantly get hot flashes that travel throughout my body that end up lasting anywhere from minutes to about 20-30 minutes. I also get weird fluttering and spasm feeling underneath my armpit on my lower pectorals. I also from time to time get random split second dizziness where ill feel like my head gets a quick jolt, i lose all sense of surroundings for a split second and ill catch myself almost as if you were dreaming you were falling and you woke up. 

Im getting to the point where im slowly losing my mind, I thought these issues would go away slowly and I would end up getting better but thats not happening. Ive spent thousands of dollars trying to figure out whats wrong with me but my doctors and specialists tell me that im healthy as can be.

1360,t3_djvkqt,Sometimes I feel like I’m being judged for my anxiety,"I’ve struggled with anxiety for a few years, about 4 or so I would say? It got really bad once I went away to college, caused me to become socially anxious etc., but once I graduated I got a job in a new state and honestly felt so much happier. I still had anxiety doing certain things but the low-low days were gone. I ended up moving again to a new job, completely across the US (west coast to east coast) and I’ve felt..okay but it’s like my anxiety is picking up again. To explain, my anxiety has kept me from doing a lot of “normal” things but I’ve worked through them. The one thing I’m still struggling with is driving. I can drive short distances or when I work through a route, but I get immense anxiety driving further than 10 minutes away from my home. My mom is pretty understanding (she suffers from anxiety as well) and thinks it’s because I need to be in control. (I lost my dad to cancer when I was 14 and a therapist I once had also told me that may have contributed to that?) anyway, I understand my anxiety pretty well, I don’t like to ask for help much and try to solve my own problems but I’m also not afraid to tell my friends or coworkers that I have anxiety. Anyway the point of this is that this week I had to say no to an assignment because of the driving (my boss was fine) but it’s like..I got mixed reviews from some people and sometimes when I have mentioned my anxiety, I’ve gotten “the look” from people? You know the “okaaaay” look? Anyway I don’t know I just felt like I needed a place to air this out. I’ve thought about seeking out therapy but honestly I’ve only used BetterHelp and I have no idea how to go about finding an in-person one.

I got to class and had the courage to admit to the teacher that I didn't yet have a presentation group, she was totally cool with it and helped me get a group. I thought she was for sure going to be disappointed in me, but she wasn't!

So I moved to sit with my presentation group and they're super nice and chill, I spoke to them quite a bit and gave them my ideas about the presentation.

Is there any one comment that you know will specifically stick with you forever?

I was 14 years old when a school employee decided to insult me. 14 years old.

I was late to class with my best friend at the time. When you arrive late, you had to go to some random classroom to get a late pass. We walked in and two older male security guards were sitting there filling out slips. When it became our turn, one of them asked us if we were sisters.

“No”, we replied and chuckled.

“Well that makes sense, because one of you is SO beautiful and one of you is SO not. Hahahahaha”.

We walked to class. During break I remember calling my mom crying about the situation. All I remember is her calling a counselor, me getting called in to explain what happened and then him getting suspended for like a week.

This was 12 years ago now and I really think this was one of the starting points for my anxiety.

I am a male,22, Indian

I am not sure what type of anxiety i have but i am unable to focus on my studies.

I always end up going blank, thinking about other stuff,being worried about future,i also daydream a lot
it's as if my mind gets clouded


It's weird but teachers say i am a student that concentrates lot,
they jumped on to the conclusion because i am always staring at book or paying full attention during lectures 

But the truth is i am unable to focus ,and really end up clouded,

When at home i will have my book open for at least 10 hours but done no single task

This has been the scenario for past 4years.

I am 22 and still haven't even completed highschool .
I've been trying to learn basics of lower grades past 4 years but i feel i am still at the same level,i have been unable to progress , staying at same pace i have always been,its driving me insane that i am unable to understand basics in subjects and progress

The middle school students literally perform better than me.

This does drive me into depression.

Could it be that i have no interest in studies?

I still want to study,become a doctor and complete my dreams...

I have joined a very expensive institute for studies ,4 months have passed but i have been nothing but a disappointment

I really want to meet the expectations of my parents and teachers.

Should i seek a psychiatrist or psychologist?

If i go to psychiatrist and take the prescribed medicines would it make my case even worst?

If that's the case i wouldn't go because i hear all the time how the medicines had negative effects 

I don't have time to trial this medicines i would rather struggle with my diseases
I have already lost so much time with trying to get education back on my track
But this is my final chance for me 
I've to score  my exams in the month of march ,
if i wont succeed I'll have to look for a job and leave my dreams.

Could this be solved without medicines?

Lastly ,sorry for my terrible English and
I'll be very grateful for any advices.

Specifically there was an instance at her gym today. She’s new to working out and there’s a fitness chick that she’s introduced herself to before (at great difficulty). Today that chick was with a group of her friends. My girlfriend wanted to say hi and ask to workout with them. Eventually she did and they said yes and were very friendly and inviting but she ended up crying in the car in the way home. She is absolutely terrified to go back because she thinks they’ll make fun of her for asking to work in with them.

Talking to people she doesn’t know absolutely terrifies her. She described it as being as scary as “swimming with snakes and piranhas.” I don’t know how to tell her that there is no hidden meaning to them being nice to her. I tried telling her that she just needs to interact with people more and she’ll feel better. Currently she lives at home with her parents but because she doesn’t have any friends in her area. In fact I’m the only person she regularly talks with. If she’s anxious she hides in her room. She’ll even skip meals if she’s anxious.

This is going to be a rant and I apologize. About 8 months ago I had a severe dissociative experience  where I felt like I was not attached to myself. All I could do was panic for about one month. Finally I went to my doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg. This helped every area of my life, I felt free of all the weights that anxiety put on me. I could do anything I wanted and I didn't care. I fell deeply in love with the woman of my dreams a month later, and love was easy without anxiety. Recently, the Lexapro made me feel completely numb. I could feel nothing at all, so I quit Lexapro and went without for a few days. The day I stopped taking the medicine I felt free again, I felt the warm fuzzies when I saw my girlfriend, I smiled when I saw the sun. I even laughed hard at some bad jokes, then the numbess returned. I worried that I didn't live my girlfriend anymore, and started having panic attacks about it. Now I feel empty and even though I can't feel anything for anyone, I am focusing on my feelings for my girlfriend the most. I'm worried I don't love her even though deep in the back of my mind I know it's the anxiety numbing me. Now I'm scared to be around her, I'm scared of losing her I'm scared of everything.

Last semester I decided to take a psychological leave and pull out for the semester. This decision did not come easy as I'm the eldest in an immigrant asian family. In my culture, I'm expected to finish my schooling, get a ""good"" job, and lift some of the burden off my parents. But I was very suicidal at the time, and I was scared I would finally go through with it. I decided that for the sake of my safety, I had to pull out and seek help.

So I went to therapy for 4 months, I started to feel more stable and I am now back in school. I was advised not to find a job for this semester as I'm still transitioning back into the school environment. My parents have been hammered by medical bills from my grandparents abroad, and I haven't been able to afford therapy. I started the semester off well, but my anxiety returned and I feel like I'm slipping again. I've been holed up in my room for the past week, I only leave my house to make my parents think I went to class. I've been very anxious, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm a huge burden on my family. I haven't been able to do my work, and I feel utterly useless.

1384,t3_djolms,Had an interesting thought about how this started... can someone confirm this?,"So I have suffered from a severe anxiety disorder for majority of my entire life. I believe I was too sheltered as a child. My mother was very caring and I found most of my comfort being along her side but my father was about as comfortable as being next to a nazi general in auschwitz. I remember being frantic when I started pre school. I didn’t understand school, nor did I understand why my mother couldn’t stay with me at pre school.

I would frantically search for her and feel like I was being abandoned. I remember refusing to go with the teachers at all coasts. This is starting to make me tear up as I write this. My mother was distressed seeing her son screaming for her, she stayed strong most of the time and would leave and come back to get me. 

The shear panic I began to feel was just the beginning. as I grew up I did not begin to overcome the anxiety of being with out my mother until around the 4th grade after hard core conditioning by teachers and my parents, not to mention be bullied for “crying for my mom” so often by my peers. All I could think about while being in school though was being back in the comfort of my home. 

This lead to me daydreaming and finding it hard to understand school, because when I wasn’t thinking about the safety of my home, I was panicking about not understanding school. I struggled due to my attempts to cope with being away from home while in school. As a consequence, I received poor grades. This is where my earliest memories of my father come into play.

My father would scold me. Spank me, lift me by the bare chest (his strength was ungodly, still is) and scream in the most terrifying voice that I’ve ever heard.. I can specifically remember that fear When I would act up as a child via at a restaurant I would be dragged to the bathroom to be slammed up against a wall, scolded and spanked more times than one could ever count. I have to keep pausing this post so I don’t burst out in tears.

As I grew, I still didn’t understand what anxiety really was or if it was a real thing. I would hide my report cards in hopes that my father would never find them. He always eventually did though. I even began to improve, but if there was any poor grade letter It would be the same terrifying routine, over and over again. 

I became this numb to the core being, I made little friends but I always remembered being admired by my friends parents for how I addressed them and how well behaved I was. I never understood that either. I thought all kids acted like I did. I had been engineered to always say yes sir/ma’am or no sir/ma’am. I still don’t know if this was normal parent behavior and I know others have had it much worse than me but does anyone else feel like this contributes to my fears in today’s world? 

I’m an emt and have been in college on and off for about 4 years now going for nursing. The problem is I still fear going to school, even though I’m on the deans list and have amazing grades I still fear a poor grade. I don’t even live at my parents anymore but if I do receive a bad grade I take it out on myself like my father did. I shake when I’m in class, I have had issues socializing for over 20 years but am now starting to come around. Whenever I fail at something in life I’m right back in that place of fear.

1387,t3_djn2m2,"Please help, losing hope","Hey guys, going to provide the story where this all begins. 23 years old.

Was traveling to a 5am job interview one day, skipped morning breaksfast / toilet break to arrive on time. Unfortunately pooped myself as I pulled into the job interview and had an awkward encounter. Managed to clean up and had a spare pair of underwear in the car and went about the job interview. During the trial, I had to use the rest room multiple times and just felt sick so I decided to go home.

All was fine and tried again at the same place a few days later, managed to get there with no issues. But during the trial, felt sick again and had to go home - No excessively toilet usage.

This was 3 months ago, since then I've been constantly anxious and can barely leave my house. Every time I have to leave, I get terrible knots in my stomach and have to use the rest room and once I'm driving I get terrible bouts of panic and anxiousness and need to find the nearest restroom.

Last week I went to a psychiatrist and was put on 7.5mg of Miratazapine. I've noticed they've given me the ability to sleep without overthinking and quieted down my anxiety slightly but still unable to leave the house without symptoms. I've now moved up to 15mg and not feeling much different.

Some days I'm able to drive for \~30 minutes and push through my anxiety and symptoms and other days like when I had my psych appointment, I had to pull over half way there in an 8km drive and duck into a fast food resturant to use the toilet. I'm not sure how to expain it, but I know I'm getting anxious over nothing in my head but symptoms just come on and I can't push through them like I have previously in life.

So far I've changed my diet completely, getting plenty of fibre in, working out semi-regularly, fixed my sleeping, getting plenty of sun and taking multi vitamins (vit D, b12, fish oil and a probiotic). This is literally ruining my life, I've been out of work and eating through savings to pay bills, unable to keep up with friends or do anything a normal person would.

The Psychiatrist thinks I have - Social Anxiety, Generalised Anxiety and a Panic Disorder. I've had practically a parent die and two cousins pass away in under a year and a half, so he thinks this could have helped trigger this. I'm looking to see a psychologist as soon as possible.    


I really want to get back to my old self, going out with friends and working. Any words of encouragement or previous experiences? Please. Thank you.

My superior asked where I went and I said, I was anxious and needed sometime to reset so I would be more productive.

I have been having a terrible time with my anxiety and depression lately but mostly anxiety. I have been waiting three months for a psychiatrist appointment which I finally had today and she prescribed me 100mg of pristiq. I’ve never taken an SNRI before but I’ve tried at least 3? Or 4 SSRIs at the maximum dose that have helped my depression but haven’t touched my anxiety which is my main concern at this point. Since deciding to get actual help and stop drinking instead of seeing a doctor, I’ve been seeing a therapist weekly following going to a stress center after a very bad panic attack and feeling really suicidal. Now that I’ve stopped drinking, all the problems that I’d been drinking to help have come back with a vengeance. None of this really matters I guess but I am just nervous to take this medication as one of the “common” side effects is nausea. I had an eating disorder for a while and am struggling with that lately as well and am TERRIFIED of throwing up.

However, I warn anyone that this is a terribly stressed and triggering thing to do. My employer hired the top law firm. I had a clear cut case, but they put me through four depositions. On the final deposition, on a friday, the attorneys had dug up stuff about my personal like, my depression, my family, and just shoved it in my face. I left the deposition and drove home feeling suicidal. The only two persons who I could talk to about this were my family and my partner as I was under an NDA. I made it through Friday, but on Saturday, I was home all day alone and just fell apart. I self-medicated and passed out. It was the only thing I knew to do.

I’m currently receiving mentoring for my difficulties - centred around how I can get through university, counselling and cbt. It’s hard to put into practice what they teach during cbt, especially when you’re overcome with anxiety. I’m not a massive fan of counselling but my mentoring is wonderful. 

I have trouble with feeling very panicky before going to university, it got so bad for the days I’ve missed, I just had to not go in. I felt like a failure but I also felt better for not going (I know this is only a short term feeling). 

What will help with my anxious feelings before going into university? I have had extremely bad experiences with anti-depressants so I do not want to take them. In the UK benzodiazepines are rarely diagnosed (as well as many other anxiety focused medications). I’m not sure what to do.

1404,t3_djo7d9,Abandonment issues.,"I read somewhere that it's like you're afraid of getting your leg shot so you shoot your own leg so no one else can and the funny thing is, you'll be hurt in the end regardless of who shoots your leg. 

and that's when i realized that i was so stupid for doing exactly that but with my relationships with the people around me. 

It sounds so stupid when it's the concept of getting shot physically, but when it comes to real life and relationships  it just feels so different.

I've had abandonment issues for as long as i remember, i just didnt know they were an issue. I saw it as a smart way to protect myself from getting hurt until someone close to me pointed out that something was wrong. The funny thing is i was trying to distance myself from this someone close because i was starting to get attached to them. 

I looked it up, and i have all the symptoms. I purposely sabotage my relationships so that when the person finally leaves i can comfort myself with the knowledge that i caused it through bad behaviour. The more i like someone, the more i distance myself from them. I need constant reassurance that they arent gonna leave me and if i dont get it, i jump to conclusions. 

It's comforting because i didnt sabotage the relationship and the other person ends up leaving me, it means somethings wrong with me.
When i treat someone badly and they leave, it doesn't feel like abandonment. It's fucked up i know, but i believe that everyone is gonna leave me one day so what's the fucking point?

Sometimes even the possibility of being suddenly interrupted is enough to make it hard to focus. And the feeling in my gut is frustration; I need to focus, why are you distracting me now?

The consequence, of course, is that I come off as cold and antisocial, offering only perfunctory responses and little in the way of small talk. As a result, I feel that I'm pushing away my colleagues and sacrificing some valuable and enjoyable relationships in doing so. But the anxiety remains.

1406,t3_djr955,Been having a rough time lately.,"Hey folks. I haven’t been here before so I’m not entirely sure if this is the right place to post something like this, but it’s been a rough few months and I just wanted to lay out my thoughts/anxieties in a safe place.

A few months ago, my boss quit her job to focus on her other passions. She is someone I have immense respect for, and we had (and still have, as she stops by once a week) a very good relationship. When she put in her notice, she encouraged me to apply for her position, which I did. After a nerve-wracking few weeks, I got the job. In a lot of ways, this position is much better for me - for one thing, I’ve never been much of a people person, and this promotion marked a transition from being a front desk clerk to having my own private office. It’s also a better schedule and, of course, better pay. On the other hand, I’m the boss now, which is not a position I am used to. I am constantly worrying about messing up. It’s not the sort of job where me making a mistake would hurt anyone (I work at a library), but it’s also not a job I studied or trained for - basically, I’m in a very small town, the library staff is minuscule, and the board didn’t have a lot of other choices, so I kind of lucked into the job. As a result I feel like if I mess up, it just proves that I shouldn’t have gotten the position in the first place because I’m not qualified.

Immediately after my promotion I had to hire two new employees - one to fill my previous position, and one to fill the position of another employee who was retiring. We only have a staff of four (including me) so this was a pretty major shift in staff. I hired the two people who I felt were the most qualified, and while both are doing a good job, there is one I am having issues with (overstepping boundaries, personality conflicts with the other new hire, etc.). These issues aren’t major, but they are adding up, and it’s difficult to discuss them with the employee because they get very defensive.

On top of that, there is an after-school program that my library runs, and I have had a few issues with some of the mentors for that program as well. Without getting into too many details, I had reason to believe they were being exclusionary toward certain segments of our community and when I addressed this with them, they got very upset. It seems to have calmed down now, but they went as far as to call the board of trustees about it to complain, and I feel it’s only a matter of time before things get out of hand again, though I hope I’m wrong about that.

Compounding things is the fact that my therapist - a wonderful woman who I immediately clicked with and who did an awesome job every session - had to retire due to medical issues around the same time as my promotion, so I’ve gone through most of this without therapy. It took several months to get reassigned a therapist at the place I go to, and while I am finally having regular sessions again and the therapist is fine, I definitely don’t connect with her on the same level I did with my last one.

Finally, last month, my wife and I moved from a small apartment to a large house. It’s mostly been very positive - lots more space, no neighbors, still comfortably in our budget, etc. However, we’ve had an issue with some of the electrical work, and our landlords haven’t been great about fixing it. They are going through a family emergency right now, so I don’t want to push them about this, but I’d also like to be able to actually use my kitchen properly.

Oh, and my wife hates her job and wants to quit and possibly leave the area next year. I’m supportive of her leaving her career as I know how stressful it has been of late, and I know she won’t push for us to move if I’m enjoying my job,  but I’d be lying if I said the prospect didn’t scare me. For one thing, she makes more than I do, even after my promotion. and I’m not sure if she’ll be able to find a new position that matches her current salary. We have room in our budget to take a bit of a financial bit, especially if we cut back on certain things, but as someone who grew up in a family that had money issues, I’ve always been very nervous about losing money.

Basically, over the last few months, I’ve been very anxious about work, my house, and the future. I really wish I had a cat or a dog because I often feel like just being able to snuggle up with a pet or something (particularly when my wife isn’t home or is asleep or otherwise is unable to offer comfort) would be very calming.

1413,t3_djqfwn,Mental Aspects Of Panic Disorder... HELP.,"Hi everyone,

I was diagnosed w/ depression and panic disorder nearly 20 years ago. Initially, I had the common physical symptoms: chest pain/tightness (OMG Im having a heart attack!), shortness of breath (OMG I cant breathe!), numbness/tingling, etc. After a bought with agoraphobia, I was hospitalized and I sought treatment in 2007 and was put on Zoloft and Klonopin. They worked wonders. I was able to feel like myself again and live a normal, happy life. Recently the Zoloft crapped out on me after nearly 11 years. My doc decided to switch to Lexapro along with the Klonopin. First month was great, second not so great. We upped my dose to 20MG of Lexapro which gave an increase in anxiety (on top of the insane anxiety I was already feeling). However, for the past 5 years or so, my anxiety has been different. I dont get the physical symptoms. I get the mental symptoms. Spiraling, racing, obsessive thoughts. An overwhelming feeling of terror where I need to leave my current surroundings. Blurred vision. A feeling of derealization. A 24/7 feeling of dread. Breakdowns where I just cry and am terrified to even move because ""what if"" getting off the couch makes the anxiety worse. I cant work. I cant make plans with friends. Its debilitating. And when the spiral of thoughts starts, I have no way of stopping it. The rational side of my brain can tell myself ""Dude, its just stress hormones making you feel this way, relax, youve been through this before, youll be okay"" but the anxious side of my brain is saying ""ITS HAPPENING AGAIN! YOURE ABOUT TO LOSE IT! YOU NEED TO BE TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW! GET OUT OF HERE. GO HOME! ITS JUST GONNA GET WORSE. AND EVEN IF IT PASSES ITS GONNA COME BACK"" What do you guys do for the mental symptoms of anxiety attacks? Any help is appreciated.

I just couldn't bring myself to go into the store. All my previous shopping has been online but I really needed pants for my job so I said fuck it, I'm going shopping.

1423,t3_djoa9f,New-ish to Anxiety,"Hey all, I had been super stressed out with various life events (some minor health issues, work stress, relationship stress) and it all came to a head and popped about a month ago on a plane and I had a crazy panic attack for the first time in my life. Since then I feel like ive been battling daily anxiety related to it. 

It’s not really that I have anxiety about doing anything particularly, like I still go out and do social things and actually feel better when I’m deeply involved in some activity. The part I am struggling with is I am feeling anxiety about feeling anxiety. When I’m alone or in thought it always traces back to this feeling of having anxiety and that alone is what’s giving me issues. I feel like I’m stuck in this feedback loop because the days where its not been on top of mind, ive been completely fine but then I can wake up and think about it and it sits there all day.

I’m working on some mindfulness/meditation things and reading the book ‘feeling good’ but honestly I cannot figure out how to manage this. It feels kind of like a PTSD lingering over from the panic attack where I’m feeling like anxiety might push me back to that feeling and that gives me anxiety but struggling on how to process and work through this.

I work closely with a small group of people, but I'm friendly and I usually feel the need to say hello if I'm passing someone in the halls. 

As I'm walking, I'll say hello and moments later, I'll often mouth the greeting to myself in the same cadence. I'm analyzing the phrase I said and my delivery.

1425,t3_djnyij,(Potentially triggering) Let’s share our weird things 🤭🙃,"So, I just recently started to become way more aware of how many of my thoughts are actually anxious thoughts - probably has to do with the fact that I just recently started seeking help for it, and joined subreddits like these. Anyway, as I’ve come to learn about my anxiety I’ve also become aware of all the bizarre thoughts I have that control my behavior. I thought it might be fun (and I guess a bit liberating) if we share some of the weird, repetitive, bizarre thoughts we have that we tend to keep to ourselves because they’re dark, embarrassing or just out right freaky.

Here are a few of mine:
We have quite a lot of people living next to the highways here in SA. So, whenever I drive on them I always think someone’s going to run across the road in front of me and I’m going to hit them. 

Whenever I’m feeling anxious I feel like I look like a twitchy drug addict (anxiety about having anxiety - the worst kind of loop). On a side note, I actually made a video of myself the other day when I was having a panic attack. It was honestly just because I felt like speaking to someone but couldn’t actually face anyone at the time. I watched it a couple of days later and to my surprise I looked completely normal. Honestly always thought that I wore anxiety over my body like a siren, so that was cool to see. 

Whenever I cook in a kitchen with someone and I have to move around with a sharp knife in my hand, I get scared that I’m going to trip, fall, and stab them. It makes me move around the kitchen like a fucking knife-protections robot.

Speaking about kitchens, when I place knives and forks in the dishwasher I have to place them so that they face downwards (towards the floor). Because, well, what happens if someone trips in the kitchen when the dishwasher is open and falls on top of them?

So silly, but so freaking real!! Haha, hope this works 🤞",Anxiety
1426,t3_djlb69,this is what my psychiatrist prescribed me. Any thoughts?," So, long story short, I (M) suffer from mild anxiety/depression. It's bad enought that it's negatively impacting my life. I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time in my life and he prescribed me 10 drops of Paxil and 10 drops of xanax every day. He suggested starting with 3 drops and then moving slowly towards 10. Now, I made it clear that I was scared of any possibile sexual side effects and he told me that at that dose they are very unlikely to happen. He called it a *paediatric* dose. I also mentioned my initial idea of simply relying on xanax during stressful situations and exercise/meditate more. He told me that it's a bad idea to take medication only during bad days and that one should try to make things better in the long run (so by taking a small dose every day and having regular therapeutic sessions).

What do you guys think? I do want to deal with my problems, but I don't like the idea of taking medication everyday. Also, Paxil  scares the shit out of me. Thoughts? For context, I already exercise 4 times a week, I don't drink coffee and I sleep a lot. I initially wanted to get a prescription for xanax and then find a good psychologist to teach me about CBT, but I don't know if that's the right idea anymore.",Anxiety
1427,t3_djno7f,Stopped my medication - any success stories of feeling like you're back to normal? I need them.,"I stopped taking fluvoxamine a month ago and seroquel 3 weeks ago. I felt completely cured - I stopped eating refined sugar, changed my diet to whole foods, meditated and read daily, exercised 5 days out of the week, I was really happy. I felt like the medication was giving me more sporadic depression, though, and I made the decision to get myself off of it. *I'm 20 years old and I've been on both Seroquel and a handful of different medications since I was 14. 

I weaned myself off and never saw my psychiatrist again to tell her about it. The weaning process was easy and the worst I experienced was brain zaps for a few days. 

Lately, I've been experiencing some feelings that makes me feel not so much like myself and it's difficult to get into a better headspace these days and be the person that I was, because I feel anxious and it's as if something is holding me back. 

I really don't want to get back on medication. It cost too much money for me, and I wasnt a highly depressed or anxious child but I was a mildly depressed and anxious teenager. I'm in therapy to figure out if my self-talk is the issue, and I'm going to schedule an appointment to see a gastroenterologist about my stomach issues maybe being a culprit.

1430,t3_djktqg,I made a major career decision that was influenced by text anxiety and insomnia,"I always wanted to be in the same profession as my dad and I now currently work in a support role at his office. I recently told them that I wanted to try again and it was fine...for about three days. This is when the anxiety for this test (which I planning on taking  in 6 months) started to physically and mentally shut me down. I couldn’t sleep normally for 3 days. I begged for rest and I went for the nuclear option. I told my parents I don’t want to attempt to get into the profession.

Que upset and angry parents who don’t understand how I back tracked so quickly when I was the one to bring it up.

But they never understood I’ve been dealing with anxiety all my life. Through two degrees, three failed admissions exams, and daily life sometimes. I always just would be thorough and prepared and it would keep my anxiety down. But not this time.

This was the first time my mind and body were telling me to stop. I’ve always struggled with the expectations of others on me. To be a good student to get into the profession, to be a good son, to be a good person. I’ve always felt the weight of the world on my shoulders in my attempt to look ok. I’ve had break downs in the past, a night of crying due to a failed test here, a near outburst in a school clinic that threatened my ability to get my support role certification (I survived and thrived in it now which is why my parents want me to try again) and then the sessions of therapy in college for my classes, my fear of connecting with others and fear of intimacy though wanting this so much in the past.

I now have anxiety over the long term prospects of my career knowing it won’t lead to me going into the family business and the job I have has burnout and physical problems on the body as you get older. I’m in the process of getting therapy (and medications if necessary) and exercising to keep the strain on my body lower so I can go the distance with this job but you prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

In conclusion, I’m just so tired of people of telling me to count my blessings. A great family and support system, no rent, no expenses, guaranteed work (for now until whenever my father decides to retire). All I have to do is work enough to pay off loans and make enough to save towards I don’t know anymore. It all doesn’t help me when that chilled feeling runs down your spine, you feel cold, you need to use the bathroom to pee and shit all day and most of all, the haunted racing thoughts that come at you so fast you can’t process them, that make you double check your work, wonder if you missed something vital with a patient that someone else will immediately notice and cause them to report you even though nothing was wrong at all because you did your job too well and still struggle with time management because you can’t let things go. And the sleepless nights, this was not the first time and I doubt it will be the last.

I’ve put myself in a job that is great if your thorough but makes me wonder if I’ll make a mistake despite the fact that support role workers are not usually fired or punished for the mistakes I believe will happen if I’m not thorough in my work (which will never happen).

In all, I’ve got a lot of things I should be blessed to have but I realize that I’m not dependable when it matters. Sure I’m great in support roles but when the lights are all focused on me, when people need you to step up and pass that test despite the odds, when people expect great things from you, you crumble when it matters.

My family believes I can be great, my job and my achievements say I could be great. But I don’t believe that, I struggle to just be good or ok most days.

Symptom overlap includes: *Extremely strong or inhibited emotions
Feeling different from everyone else, though perhaps not knowing why
Difficulty forming and maintaining relationships
Social difficulties
Enjoyment of being alone
Hyperactivity or passivity
Startling easily
Repetitive movements
Sleep issues
Perfectionism and need for control
Stress-related troubles
Avoidance of eye contact*

**Autistic people deal with social confusion, and may have trouble understanding what others are thinking and feeling. Communication is a challenge. People with CPTSD can be fearful or moody, and may self-isolate.[5]
A healthy autistic person usually wants to have some friends. Someone with CPTSD may feel safer when they're alone.

1435,t3_djmx4i,Sorry it’s a little long,"Hi, so I’m not sure if I really do have anxiety. Maybe minor anxiety (if that’s even a thing) but lately I’ve been really down in the dumps and I’ve had this sick feeling in my stomach like a knot in my belly when I thought about going to work (I’ve been working there for over 3 years and with Christmas coming up have been very busy during work). So I think I might just be overworked or just no longer enjoy my job. 

I’m a very private person, I don’t talk about the hard emotions. I keep it all inside until I snap, sometimes I don’t even know I’m about to snap until it happens. 

I didn’t notice my behaviour had changed until my boyfriend asked me a scary question “Are we all right?” I didn’t realise that I had completely cut myself off from my boyfriend. Didn’t spend time with him just wanted to be alone, and barely talked to him when I was home. 

That question scared the hell out of me. I didn’t realise I was making him think those thoughts. I didn’t  know what to do. The only thing I could think of was to go to work and tell my boss that I was feeling anxious about work and that it was effecting my home life. We talked it out which was hard as shit. Tried to get to the source which I’m still not sure if i did. I was hoping that if I spoke to him I would feel a little better. 

But he seemed very understanding, but the next day I felt like he was treating me like a delicate little flower. And the other lady’s I work with keep asking me if I’m alright. Keep giving me funny looks. 

Talking to him didn’t get rid of the feeling it’s still there, maybe a little more so because I feel like they’re constantly looking at me and keeping an eye one me or even judging me. I could be paranoid because that’s how I’ve always felt after talking about my feelings.

They eventually found that I had an arrhythmia but after 5 months of not knowing what was wrong with me I definitely became pretty anxious about it not knowing if something seriously was wrong. Like if my foot was hurting worst case I lose my foot but like damn If my heart stops I die and idk about you guys but death is fucking scary to me. 

Anyways so my issue now is that anxiety/panic attacks and arrhythmia (I have SVT) episodes both have the same symptoms more or less so I can’t even distinguish the two esp since I don’t really know what normal anxiety feels like without heart issues. 

So fast forward to tonight, I was in a debate conference and usually I can public speak well but when it came to me I had the heart palpitations and shit and completely froze up. Just like quiet and babbling nothing for a while as people stare at you and I had to just pass my turn. It was one of the most humiliating things and I have to go back to debate tomorrow morning and I’m honestly still cringing. 

I guess this was mostly a vent Bc I feel sick to my stomach about this, but also if people have experience with anxiety attacks in public like that or have any tips on differentiating physical feelings with mentally caused ones then that would be super helpful.

I've been suffering with both general anxiety and social anxiety for years, but only realized how severe it was last year.

I'm relieved that I am finally brave enough to seek help, but I can't deny that I'm also scared. Part of my anxiety involves holding back from telling people things about me, and I find myself doing the same during my first consultation with my therapist. I could sense that I was still afraid to tell a stranger my deepest fears, even though I know it's someone who can help me and would need me to tell her my secrets so she can help me. She's a Brainspotting practician so we're going with that, and while the claims are that it won't include as much talking as a regular talk therapy, I still feel apprehensive on the prospect of blurting all my deepest fears and traumatic memories to a complete stranger.

1455,t3_djkshq,"Anxiety attack, panic attack or something else.","A girl that I really liked asked me over tinder would I be interested on going on a date with her. I hadn't spoke to her in months since the last time we dated. (She ghosted me after a couple of dates 8 months ago). But I got over that and was willing to give it another shot

As soon as she sent the text asking would I go for a drink. I felt this wave of emotion, nerves, excitement, anticipation, dread, delight etc. and even though I was sitting at my desk in work after lunch I had to run to the bathroom and violently throw up. Lucky enough the bathroom was empty but as soon as I was finished I felt great and went on the date that night without further issue.

A week later after texting back and forth a bit, I had really gotten my hopes up for her (again) and she text to say it was a bad idea to meet, better we dont meet again and that she was sorry.

Straight away again I felt this wave of emotion except this time is was disappointment, confusion, failure, insecurity, regret, lovesick etc. and once again i had to run to the toilet to violently throw up my dinner. I had been sitting at home watching TV on my own.

Regardless of the girl messing me around, its my reaction that I am worried about.

This happens to me more often than I like to admit over the years but its always related to dating and more specifically related to dating someone who I've really fallen for, someone who I would class out of my league or ultimately someone I get nervous around.

Is this a symptom of Anxiety ? Or a sign of a panic attack ? Its certainly not a normal reaction.

1458,t3_djkmo9,I have never had a close relationship.,"I have just finished up the last day of my last year of high school. It's a pretty reflective time, and I've come to realise that I've never had a close relationship with anyone. I have acquaintances, but no one who i speak to regularly. I don't have a friend group, and to be perfectly, there's never, apart from family, been someone who thinks about me or cares about how I'm feeling. It's become a lonely life.

I think it might have to do with my anxiety. I'm afraid to reach out to people for fear of looking stupid, annoying them, or embarassing myself at all. I've also been told that i give off the vibe that I'm a confident, well adjusted human being instead of the anxiety riddled mess that is actually me. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? Any suggestions from people who have been in similar situations?

So, I didn't start smoking weed until I was 29. I loved how it made me feel relaxed. I've always had somewhat of an anxiety issue but it was very manageable. It didn't control my life.. Until I had my first panic  attack 6 months ago from today.. 

Im on my way to work, Its @ 5am &amp; im @ a stop light. Feeling quite relaxed.. &amp; then all hell breaks loose.. 

First I felt my chest/heart vibrating..&amp; I couldn't breathe. Within seconds I get hit with an intense feeling of Dread &amp; Impending Doom. All I could think was ""Heart Attack""..  &amp; within seconds im out on the road, holding my chest, watching my life flash before my eyes. I sat down in the middle of the street ready to dial 911 but I couldn't bring myself to do so because the emergency department they would've taken me to is where I work. I was only Few minutes away. I ended up freaking out even more &amp; I felt so alone. I thought I was going to die there in the middle of the road. I started yelling out for help. For anyone, but there was no one around. No traffic, no people. @ this point I'm convinced that I'm experiencing my last moments on earth. I'm not religious but I started praying.. I sat there simply praying.. I don't know for how long but it felt like eons. 

Fast forward some time &amp; I'm back in my car. In tears. Completely confused, @ a loss for words, my life felt shattered, I felt super vulnerable...I knew then my life will never be the same. But still, I drove off &amp; went to work. It was a 16 hr shift.. I didn't tell anyone what had just transpired. Wore a mask all day &amp; when I got home, the second I closed my door behind me, I balled my eyes out.. I don't remember much after that. 

That was the last time I smoked weed.. 

Now I deal with Heart palpitations which are constant, Internal tremors, Trouble sleeping, health anxiety etc. 

I'm leaving out so much stuff that I probably should add but its late.. &amp; It takes me quite some time to fall asleep because of heart palpitations.. I would do anything to go back &amp; not smoke that morning. Or ever for that matter.. What I experienced that morning is still with me. It felt like I went to Hell &amp; part of me is still there. I hope this post reaches a lonely soul out there seeking answers the way I did.

I suffer from GAD, social anxiety and health anxiety, and it has been going on for a about a year. It all started when I got sick way back in 2017 and it really took a toll on me both mentally and physically. I was so sick that I was afraid I was going to die.. So it has been very hard for me to recover from that. 

I am fighting my demons and really trying to get better. But I am right now in a very difficult situation and I do not know how to handle my anxiety regarding this. My sweet old grandmother is dying. She is slowely fading away and she has only a couple of days left on this earth. This has really broken my heart and triggered my health/death anxiety to the maximum. But my poor mom is absolutely devastated. She is broken and cant stop crying and I feel so, so bad for my mother. I want to help and be there for both my grandmother and mother but I just feel so scared and lost.

How do I help a loved one when my anxiety is tearing me apart? How do I put this stupid anxiety aside and find the strenght to help my mom?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any tips and welcome…

I don't know if they were having an episode or something, but they somehow turned us wanting the same thing into me wanting them to never get better care, and I only want money. They did it very skillfully, twisting my words in on themselves. Making me feel like I'm part of the problem because my profession is in helping people get benefits they desperately need. That I'm not allowed to help people from within the system or I'm upholding the status quo for a paycheck.

And I.... I just went silent. I put down my phone, curled in a ball on my couch, and just sat, silently, unable to respond to even my fiance who was sitting next to me watching TV. I couldn't even cry even though I wanted to so badly.

1465,t3_djcfzd,i feel myself slipping away,"I feel like i’m losing myself

hey everybody, this is my first post on reddit and i’m a little nervous about it honestly. 

basically, in the shortest summary possible, i struggle deeply with anxiety and depression. i have a lot of childhood trauma from a verbally/emotionally abusive relationship with my alcoholic mother who passed away three years ago. she planted seeds of self loathing in me which i deal with every minute of everyday. 

i’ve dealt with my anxiety and depression for years, but lately it feels like it is spiraling completely out of control, and i’m becoming someone i don’t know. like i’m becoming less and less myself, and more and more of my illness. 

i’ve gone through points in my life where i’ve hit rock bottom. a few years back i was ready to commit suicide, so i was hospitalized into an intensive outpatient program for months that truly saved my life. i’ve gone through normal bouts of depression and when things are tough in my life i tend to have a tougher time than most dealing with them, but lately it feels different. 

i’m a 25 year old woman who works full time in a school and goes to college full time. i’ve been attempting to complete my degree since i started in 2012, but after my mom died everything kinda fell off the rails and i’ve had a difficult time completing school. now, this semester is my last chance (financially) to finish, so i’m really buckling down. i even dropped down my days at work to ensure i could focus on school. i am kept very, very busy by this schedule. i typically spend my free time performing in community theatre, but i’ve put a pause on that to also focus on school. 

i have an incredible boyfriend who i’ve been seeing for about 6 months now. he is truly amazing, especially after coming out of an abuse on/off 5-year-long relationship. it’s unbelievable to have someone treat me the way i’ve always wanted to be treated, and better. he’s lovely. i also have an incredibly supportive and amazing best friend who  id be lost without. i have a perfect dog, and a gorgeous niece who is the brightest light in my life. 

generally, things are good right now. i have a wonderful support system, i’m keeping up with school and being productive while sustaining my job, and i spend as much time as i can with the people i love and giving myself some me time. 

still, i feel myself slipping away, and more intrusive, obsessive, irrational thoughts filling the spaces. horrible thoughts about my relationship, myself, my life. it’s constant. it’s all the time, and it’s genuinely a black cloud over my head every day. i feel like there’s something physically blocking me from being happy, even when everything’s aligned perfectly. constant thoughts that my boyfriend is going to leave me or find someone else, or my brain finding things he “does wrong” for me to be upset over even when he hasn’t. i try so hard to counter these thoughts because i so badly don’t want to feel this way anymore, but it’s near impossible. 

usually, when i’m with my people i feel that pure happiness and like everything’s gonna be okay. but lately that overwhelming feeling of anxiety and intrusive thoughts snake their way in even then. it’s just constant. i feel out of control of everything. like my body is going through the motions but a little monster has taken over my brain and i can’t get back in control. 

i have gone to therapy on and off for years and respond really well to it, but with my schedule right now it’s impossible for me to go and will be until december/january, so i feel like i just have to resign myself to feeling terrible until then. 

i don’t really know what i’m looking for on here, honesty. support? advice? i just wanted to get the words out of my head and into the world and maybe that would help give me some clarity. 

truly, thank you if you read all this, and thanks for any kind words you can leave me.",Anxiety

1478,t3_djjdln,Badly Misread My Partner's Feelings - Need Help Understanding Anxiety Perspectives,"Background: My partner suffers from what is likely a form of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. In the past, my lack of insight into understanding how they feel has led to points of conflict in our relationship, but the fights/arguments centered on these events are generally rare - maybe once per year.  They often flare up around the time that I have more work commitments. I am a graduate student working on my yearly progress update to my supervisory committee. Preparation around these updates involve, usually, a month of hard work  - putting in time on the weekends, spending late nights in the lab to finish experiments, using ""off"" time outside the normal 9-5 to analyze data &amp; prepare results for presentation, etc. My partner works a stable job, but is also doing course-based graduate work. We both have 2nd jobs/side-hustles for extra cash. Bottom line is, we are both VERY busy, and any moments of spare time, we usually spend together.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to the actual incidents: My partner was in a minor fender bender yesterday morning. They tried to call me when it happened, but I had slept in because I had been up late working on my graduate work. I missed the call. When I wake up, we \*normally\* text each-other in the morning. When either of us are very busy, more so than usual, it is not unusual for us to miss this morning check-in. I always check in at lunch-time, no exceptions. So on this day, I looked at my phone but did not see the notification for a missed call. I saw no text, and made the decision to wait until lunch for the check-in. When I did check in, my partner shared that they were in a  fender bender, and I immediately called my partner. We talked, they mentioned they had called a family member for help when I was not available, and that they had already discussed insurance matters etc. My partner was making jokes about how I need to her them a driver for the future. I interpreted this conversation as them being okay, and not overwhelmed by the incident.

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the day, when my partner was done work, they headed off to a therapy session. They had not been to a proper session before, and I had told them that I could accompany them to the session. I previously researched this location, went to a group meeting by myself for supporters of anxiety, and weeks later took them to meet the staff/therapist in an introductory/in-take meeting. I feel that if I had not done this footwork, my partner would not be attending or seeking therapy to help with their anxiety at all. Maybe I am wrong about that, but it's how I feel. Regardless - being so overwhelmed with work, I forgot that their session was today. I owned up to this mistake as soon as they told me they were headed to the session. A week previously, my partner had mentioned that if I was so busy, they could go alone. I truly feel awful that I missed taking them, and being there for them in that moment. In being pre-occupied with work, I made an assumption that because they had offered to go alone, they would be able and confident enough to go to the session without undue stress or anxiety over the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

In the evening, my partner asked me to come over. Citing my work preparation with a deadline of the next day, I told them that I could not come over. I offered instead for them to come over to me - perhaps stupidly not considering the driving incident from before. I then offered to pick them up, but they declined. About an hour later I felt guilty that they felt unsafe or unsecure at home because of the morning incident, and I went to my partner's place anyway to check in on them. In talking with them that night, and now tonight, I have realized that I really misread the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

The concerns: My partner has vocalized that they felt unsupported. I made a number of assumptions: 1) That the fender bender was not a big deal, since it wouldn't be to me - but also because based on our phone conversation, my partner appeared to be dealing with the ordeal well. I late found out that while talking, they were in the presence of people at work and could not truly vocalize what they were feeling. I understand that I projected \*my\* would-be reaction on to my partner's experience, and I assumed they would be okay. This was a mistake. 2nd assumption) Because my partner previously offered to attend their first therapy session alone (because they knew I was busy), that they would be able to attend and go to therapy by themselves without incident. My partner did go, but in retrospect I understand that they were not happy about this. Again, I projected my own feelings onto their experience. This isn't right.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this way: on \*any other day of the year\* had these things happened, I would have been fully available. I felt powerless, being stuck between a rock and a hard place in terms of either meeting deadlines or adequately supporting my partner. I really am bothered that I ended up in a predicament like this, but my partner doesn't believe that I feel this way. I know from previous years that they had felt neglected during my peak busy times, so this year I made an effort to be more present. Even when working long hours, I would plan to do work at my partner's place instead of mine to show that I am considering their loneliness during these times. I felt like I have made an effort, but that yesterday I was put in an impossible situation with regards to responding to these situations adequately, given my deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

I fully admit that I projected my feelings onto their ability to cope with stressors. That was wrong. But I have also vocalized to my partner that there is a certain disconnect for me to instantly step into their shoes and feel how they would in such situations. I make mistakes this way, and yesterday it went very poorly. I feel like my partner does not understand this perspective. I feel like I sometimes am expected to read their mind and pull out numerous unspoken cues to re-interpret their feelings properly. Such as, inferring that because they can not speek freely at work over the phone about their feelings/need for support, that I must alter my interpretation of their speech, verbatim. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I am asking for a way to help empathize better with my partner's lived experience. I cannot get myself into their headspace over handling events like this sometimes, and it becomes a point of contention in our relationship. I try to point out the times that I have been supportive, such as researching and scouting their therapy sessions, but my partner tells me I'm ""keeping score"". From my perspective, I am trying to highlight that I am usually a good and supportive partner, but that in times of being put in impossible situations (ie, finish work or miss a critical deadline to help partner with events I \*thought\* were not undue stressors) I can come up short. I have really messed up, and I own that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't fare well here, and I let my partner down. Sometimes I feel like no matter what I do, I can't meet expectations. How much of this is stuff I need to work on, versus trying to get my partner to understand that it is not easy and automatic to put myself in their headspace over issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line: HOW CAN I HELP MY PARTNER FEEL SUPPORTED? I love them more than anything, and I really want to make this better.  I inevitably make mistakes, but I want these  mistakes to be learning experiences so that I can be a better partner. I have offered to attend group meetings for supporters of those with anxiety, and I am beginning to believe it may be beneficial for me to cope with the challenge of being in a relationship with someone affected by anxiety. I want my partner to feel supported, and let them know that yesterday was a rare occurance and not the norm for my behaviour.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all feedback is appreciated. If I am being a total dickbag, please call me out on it. I very well may need to hear that from external sources to realize it. I just want my partner to be able to trust me and feel supported.

For almost everything that happens ever, I get bad feelings about. So about a hour ago my mom calls me telling me she’s about to hop on the bus. Basically right when she hung up I got a bad feeling and bad thoughts about my mom at the bus stop. So basically she comes home and says how she almost got robbed. I don’t want to have these feelings as they give me anxiety. If I worry about everything, is this just a chance and I didn’t fore-see anything?

About 8 months ago I was coming back from the gym, ran upstairs and climbed into bed. I turned over to plug in my phone cord and that's when my arm went completely numb. I shrugged it off and kept laying down but in the back of my mind I wondered what it could be. I dumbly typed into [Dr.Google](https://Dr.Google) ""left arm pain/numbness"" and first thing that popped up was ""HEART ATTACK"" in big letters with a caution sign next to it. My mind started racing and I started to hyperventilate. I ended up calling EMS who was surprised that they were there for me(I'm 25 and in pretty good shape). They took my vitals BP was normal with a slight elevation in my pulse at 105. Everything came back normal.

I formed extreme health anxiety the next day. I thought my heart was giving out on me, i was having extreme chest pains/burning sensations and limited mobility in my left arm. Over the course of the first month I visited the E.R twice, Urgent Care at least 7-10 times, my primary care doctor 5 times, and specialists 3-4 times. Every single person who i spoke to gave me a clean bill of health. Yet here i was feeling the worst I've ever been in my life but NOTHING was wrong with me? How can that be.

My Primary doctor on my first visit, diagnosed me with severe allergies, Vertigo, Costochondritus, GERD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. He would take long listens to my heart and lungs and assured me that everything sounded healthy and fine.

I was recommended to the Cardiologist and Gastroenterology for further tests, the cardiologist had me wear an event monitor for an entire month and found nothing wrong with my EKG's that were sent back to them. 

Ever since the accident 8 months ago, I've grown into weird symptoms, I have a twitch in my left/right pectoral muscles almost where it connects to my armpits. I have a fist like pressure that happens on the bottom left side of my pec every so often. I get random Hot Flashes even if i'm in a cool environment. I get quick sharp chest pains usually after i eat something. And i get the same twitch/fluttering in my chest after a bowel movement. 

Alot of the times when I get these twitching/spasms in my pectoral, i check my pulse and it doesn't sync up with my heartbeat. Does that mean that they are not palpitations but more muscle spasms?

I feel like im going crazy and need someone to try and help because i'm losing my mind :) Send Help! Thanks!",Anxiety

1491,t3_djb2lb,physical symptoms of anxiety making anxiety worse,"So for pretty much this entire week, I (F22) convinced myself that I was pregnant. 

I was late for about 7 days (until today, woo!) and I began obsessing over it. During the day I'd be 100% certain that I was. There was no doubt in my mind. Then when I saw my boyfriend in the evenings we'd chat about it, and I'd rationalise that maybe I was just a little late because of the stress I'd been through lately. I pretty much shut down for a week. I didn't want to eat or go to the gym or leave the house. I was terrified to take a test just in case it came back positive.

I started feeling nauseous a few days ago which of course I attributed to morning sickness. Looking back, it probably had more to do with my lack of eating as well as the constant stomach-churning that is synonymous with anxiety and stress. 

The worst thing is I know my stress and the physical symptoms of my anxiety only exacerbated things and delayed it more. Now that I know I'm not pregnant, I can look back and realise what I was putting myself through.

I guess this could kinda fall under the category of health anxiety which I've been experiencing more lately (a few weeks ago I convinced myself I had non-hodgkins lymphoma). I guess my questions is:

Has anyone who deals with health-related anxiety made it worse on themselves by attributing their (anxiety-related) physical symptoms to whatever illness, disease, etc. they believe they may have? How do you deal with it?

Since the beginning of the summer I have been mostly skirting around or making up bullshit answers for a lot of her questions. It mostly revolves around my relationships with prior colleagues from school, as well my relationships with family members (mostly immediate, parents and 1 sister). I realized I was doing this back in June or July, can't remember exactly, when I gave a half-hearted answer to some question about my childhood...She responded with one of those, ""ohhhhh okay"" answers and it seemed really non-genuine, like i could see it in her  face that she didn't buy what i was selling her.. From then on I've had this idea that she is ""onto me"", that she's sniffing out my dishonesty and trying to work around it. I go into therapy appointments hypervigilant, trying to foresee the things she will bring up. Over the past couple weeks I've realized I have this mindset and that going to therapy like this seems extremely hopeless.

I have multiple personal troubles that I've never divulged to anyone...and I know that these troubles might lead us to the roots of my shame, anxiety, depression...but I cannot imagine myself telling her these things and returning to her for an appointment. Its happened to me twice before, once when I shared an experience of childhood trauma (first therapist), as well as an experience of sexual abuse (third therapist). After sharing these experiences I was so ashamed that I couldn't bring myself to show my face around their offices again. I guess a part of me doesn't want this to happen a third time, especially with a therapist I've seen for so long now...Also, I just can't see myself living with the knowledge that she knows these things about me. Whenever I try to imagine it, telling her these things, I get sick, I cringe or gag..I shake my head and just move past it in my head.

hi everyone, posting because i need some advice if anyones willing to give, flared with a TW just to be safe

im (20) currently stuck living at home with my older sibling (mid-20s) who has been emotionally &amp; verbally abusive to me for pretty much my entire life. they were physically abusive at one point (along the lines of beating me up, not sexual). this was to the extent of that i’m not really able to recall most of my childhood without becoming very upset and, combined with outside factors, led me down an early road of issues with mental health &amp; issues with suicidal ideation (this in particular isnt really as much of an issue anymore now).

basically they are one of the core triggers to my anxiety &amp; because of a recent event (beginning of this summer) i have finally given up on trying to create or maintain a relationship with them. this has come after years of explaining to both them and our parents that if things didnt change i wouldnt be keeping any sort of relationship up once older. i personally planned to do this once out of the house, but they did something (that i’d rather not go into explicitly) that was the serious last straw and broke any remaining hope.

the issue is that i have to live at home with them and my parents because i am broke, unemployed, and a college student. i have for the most part avoided having any conversation with them for the most part, but their connection as a trigger to my anxiety is strong enough so that just being near them/in the same room is greatly upsetting. 

this is coinciding/related to me recently developing new anxious behavior/triggers that are bordering OCD-tendencies, so i havent really been able to fully work through this in therapy. my general level of anxiety is debilitating to the point that i will be soon beginning medication &amp; i am spending most of my time trying to isolate myself as much as possible.

Now that I'm making roughly $200 less a week, I am struggling to stay on top of my finances. I'm currently completely broke. Not a cent to my name. Both my savings and checking accounts are in the negative. I'm in need of some car repairs that have to be done by winter or the car will not be safe to drive.

I have no friends, no social life, I haven't met anyone new since I got divorced two years ago, so I have no love life either. Even if it would've be a needless waste of money to go out, I have such terrible social anxiety that I can't handle going out alone before I feel overwhelmed and miserable. I am completely isolated. The only people I have to talk to are my family. It's not a question of me hating them, it's just that I'm not that close to them and I am not really like them in many ways, so it's hard to relate. I can't relate to anyone for that matter.

I've never been passionate about anything. Nothing interests me. I find myself caring about nothing or no one. I have nothing to look forward to. I have no kids or pets and nobody depends on me for survival, so there's nothing really motivating me. I just work and that is it. I at least have weekends off, but that means I just have more time to be left alone with my thoughts and no money to help distract me from how miserable I feel.

Only two of my immediate family have their shit together financially. One is facing cancer and the other has been spending a lot of money on trying to start a family. Neither of them has the extra money to spend. The rest of my family is almost if not equally as bad off, so I have no real options for financial help and I hate asking for money from family as it is.

I'm in my 40s for crying out loud, I shouldn't be so damn pathetic. It's no wonder why the last girl I actually got to agree to meet me, lost interest after 2 dates. I have nothing going on in my life. I have nothing to talk about. I don't fit in anywhere I go. Therapy and meds do nothing to help. I really do think that I'm done trying. I just don't care anymore. The world has gone to shit and an I can't stand most people. I don't trust anyone anymore.

I can't even get laid just for the sake of feeling any sort of connection with another person. Every damn day is the same thing. Every year is the same. I have no hopes or dreams, not a single goal. Not one suggestion is an actual solution, they're all just bandages. I'm sick of failing no matter what I do. Everything I do is wrong and I am exhausted.

1506,t3_djgwqn,Spiraling out of control,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been dealing with anxiety my entire life and I’ve only recently come to accept that I have it. About a year ago, my panic attacks got so bad that it was hard for me to go out in public. This kind of forced me to admit that I have anxiety and to finally go to therapy. Things were actually going pretty well and after 6 months or so my panic attacks were back to only happening every once and a while. I was even having days where I wouldn’t have any anxiety at all.

Recently, my husband has been having some problems of his own and he’s pretty private, likes to solve his problems by himself, that type of person. I’m trying to respect that but my anxiety is just starting to eat me alive. I can’t handle not knowing the specific details of what’s wrong with him, even though he has reassured me and promised me that it has nothing to do with me, and that it’s all about his own issues. My anxiety over this is causing me to have daily attacks. I’m constantly crying (usually how my panic starts to manifest itself). I keep turning this issue he has with himself into my problem. I have no idea how to not do this, and how to respect his boundaries. He gets really upset that I keep bringing it up because it makes him think about it more and he’s trying to be productive while he deals with this issue. 

A lot of my anxiety stems from abandonment, and the plethora of issues that I had growing up. I’m trying to work through these with my therapist, but it’s a lot to get through. Recently my mother was hospitalized. I don’t want to go into details because it might trigger someone, but part of my therapy has been to keep a distance from my mother because of how toxic she can be to my mental health. I basically have to be involved now though, since I’m her oldest child and next of kin. Her hospitalization caused me to completely lose it. I also run my own business, so I’m sure that adds to the stress. 

I just slowly spiralled into panic, and not even about her - it’s about my husband. I started looking for new apartments to live in and convinced myself whatever his problem was, it has to be about me and he must be lying.

1507,t3_djgs2r,Anxiety surrounding leaving pets,"Ok so I know this is completely irrational but need to get other viewpoints
I try my best to manage without meds but in University I did take Paxil for a few years (no withdrawals when I stopped) and again I took it for a couple of years and stopped three months ago thinking I could manage without (a week of pretty sucky withdrawals...mostly vertigo).  I always have a baseline of anxiety...pit in my stomach, irritability, tight chest, tense muscles.  But my life is pretty stress free to be honest, good marriage, stay home, good kids, doing well financially, etc.
We have three senior cats...2 of which are 19 years old and definitely show signs of aging but healthy for their ages.  I used to do animal rescue and at one point we had 11 cats but as they got older/ill we now have the 3 of them

A HUGE trigger for me is and has been going on vacation and leaving them.  It’s always for about 10 days but it’s a 4-5 hr plane ride away (we tend to go to the same place because it’s tradition...Disneyland!). I’m most afraid that something will happen and I won’t be with them to say goodbye.  Morbid I know but it seriously induced panic attacks.  I thought I was doing ok but about a week ago it started and now that we are a week away it’s getting worse.  I’m really wanting/needing to start my Paxil though I know it won’t be fully effective by the time we leave at this point.  And do I need lifelong Paxil to get through the 2-3 vacations a year we take.  I hate affecting my family like this...they know I enjoy vacation but my anxiety is obvious leading up to things.  And in my mind I know of course that’s a possibility or even something happening to us but it is what it is and you can’t live life in fear but my anxiety doesn’t listen!

Does anyone else experience anything similar?  How do you deal with it?  I don’t think a benzo would work because it’s a few weeks before and the week we are away and then when I get home I can breathe again which is why I think something like ssri better because I need to manage it over a period of time.

Mood swings, suicidal thoughts, heart palpitations, no sleep, detached from reality, muscle twitches, vomiting, i mean a lot, enough to make death look very appealing.

I guess my question is, is there anyone that has slid down this hell hole and can give me any advice/tips? Also can give me some idea of how long these physical symptoms last, the psychological part i can deal with, I've been fighting those demons forever. I know that this varies person to person, i guess i'm hoping for some sort of solace in this excruciating ordeal.

Also, i feel like hanging the doctors who prescribed this to me over a bridge, how can they feel comfortable dishing a drug like this out?

1510,t3_dj5gm9,A Guardian Angel story...my battle with anxiety has many ups and downs...but this story saved my life.,"I had been working interstate for a couple of years and suffering from severe anxiety.  Every night id try to sleep but my heart rate was through the roof.

I decided to try and find a way to eventually be transferred home to continue working.  I thought if i upskill myself that sometime down the track i would be granted a transfer.

A new boss had just been transferred to us and i was told that any study or upskilling needed to be approved by her, so i made a time to see her and spoke to her about my desire to do further training. I had never met her before and this was my first conversation with her.

I requested approval to conduct inhouse study and the first thing she did was look me right in the eyes and say ""what are you really here for?"" I said ""Sorry?!"" she said ""hows your health?""

Choking back some tears through absolute shock, I said, ""Good, you know, every ones got issues"".

She said ""The last thing you need right now is study, we've got to get you home"".

(I HAVE NEVER MET OR SPOKEN TO HER IN MY LIFE!!!)

To cut a long but amazing story short, with in a month I was back home with family, relocated, working and getting help for my anxiety.

A few weeks after my transfer I decided to send her an email thanking her and letting her know how i was going, she replied wishing me all the best and that SHE was no longer there and transfered herself back home shortly after I had left.  Within a hand full of weeks she had transfered to my work, got me out of there, then transfered herself back home.

I wish I could name her but I havent asked her permission.  She may have seen something in my body language or my eyes but what ever it was shes my Guardian Angel, because truth be told i was losing the battle.

1511,t3_dj6w2l,How to deal with Anxiety setbacks (advice from a former sufferer who has recovered),"I know what you may be wondering, ""I was doing so well, I thought I might be able to beat this thing...but then all of a sudden, my anxiety symptoms just came back with full force. I feel like I've made no progress at all.""

These were my thoughts almost every other day when I was struggling, and once I figured out how to handle these bad days, I exponentially began having better days.

I wanted to give some on how to deal with setbacks and recover. I recovered without any meds, or supplements btw. I focused on acceptance, exposure, and patience (I talk more about recovery below).

1. Recognize setbacks are a part of recovery. Many people think recovery is linear, like healing a broken bone. Truth is, recovery is more like 2 steps forward, one step back...and sometimes, its like makes 2 steps forward and 4 steps back. THAT IS A SETBACK. It's easy to think you haven't made any progress. But you have. Recognize setbacks are vital to recovery.
2. Setbacks get less intense over time. The better you get, the more resilient your nerves become. Some setbacks will be worse than others, but the main focus is not trying to figure it all out. Overtime, the intensity of setbacks decrease, and the gap between them widen until, good days and bad days feel the same...where every day is an amazing day.
3. Worst thing you can do during a setback is go back to your old habits. If you start google searching, going on forums, getting assurance from doctors...what you are really doing is trying to figure something out so that you stop these feelings. It's a sophisticated form of avoidance. Allow yourself to feel the setback and know it's part of the process.

I've created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below. I also talk about what I did to recover in way more depth in the link below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFrqgegSsKQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFrqgegSsKQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around setbacks.

1512,t3_djgg1r,"I've been crippled with anxiety all week, and I don't know if I can bring myself to go to school tomorrow. How can I get my mom to understand this?","First thing's first, my mom's a very loving person. Sometimes it's tough love, but still. Love her to death. But she doesn't really understand the whole mental-health thing. I think I have some sort of moderate anxiety problem, but when I tell my mom about it she just gives me suggestions like ""take deep breaths,"" but she never brings up taking me to a psychologist. It's also my fault for not pressing it, but I digress.

All week I've been stressing *extremely* over what I thought was mine and my family's impending doom (a long, personal story that I'd rather not tell) and it's been messing up my body, to say the least. I've never experienced stress that bad. It's almost like my muscles would twitch, and the area behind my neck (upper back?) would feel really sore. My chest would hurt. My head hurt a lot as well, and I couldn't concentrate in school whatsoever. I didn't do some of my assignments. On Tuesday, I got home from school at 4, moped around for two hours, and had the ""brilliant"" idea of taking a nap at 6 pm. I wouldn't wake up periodically, but would go back to sleep because being unconscious was the only time that I wouldn't feel so stressed. Long story short, I woke up at midnight. I stayed awake for two hours because I wasn't tired and because I was so stressed. Then finally went to sleep at 2 am.

Overall, now that the thing that's been stressing me out is on it's the way to maybe being over, my body feels really sore and tired. I'm not sure if I can go tomorrow. Thing is, I don't think simply telling my mom that my body's sore will cut it. She's sent me to school with a full-on cold (I sent myself to the office because I didn't want to get anyone else sick, I just told my mom that they forced me to go home). She's let me stay home for puking and stomach problems, though. I'm not the type to miss school either, but I really feel that I need this day. It's hard for me to be productive at all.

1518,t3_djb87b,Will try to keep this short. Got my old job back.,"I had a job a while back for almost 9 years in oil and gas. I started first having anxiety issues about 6-7 years into it, and although I took more sick days than usual, I tried not to let it effect my work. I ended up starting 2mg clonazepam a day, and that helped. Eventually, I stopped taking it after about a year or two and toward the end of my time at the company and for about 2 years thereafter, and didn’t have any issues with anxiety. I got laid off 3 years ago, and left on good terms.

Fast forward to last year. I had a panic attack out of nowhere in which I was shaking, hands had the pins and needles feeling, my face was twitching and tensing up, and ended up in the ER. Since then, have been working with my old psych on what meds to take (he won’t do clonazepam daily anymore, just .5mg as needed and is barely even willing to prescribe that) and so what we finally landed on that had been working the last few months was 40mg Prozac which I also had to use some clonazepam to begin with, and about once or so a week now. The Prozac takes away a lot of the panic feelings I’ve had, however it is not a cure all. It just doesn’t let me get to the point of no return like when I had the ER visit. 

About a month ago, I got word that the old company was looking for the position I did, and now that I had an MBA and the position would offer a decent amount of money, I took it. 

I took 3 weeks prior to starting, I start tomorrow, and have slowly been getting more anxiety ridden during the week. I chose a Friday to start to try to hold back some of the anxiety; they will be more lax on Friday, it will be an easy day. However my mind always jumps ahead to ‘what about next week when I have to work the whole week, what about when I used to have panic attacks there, what if I have to go home, what if something triggers it, what if etc etc etc’ And it has been that way the whole day. 

I went back to the psych earlier this week and he did up my Prozac to 60mg and said we can always take it back down, but that it helps with some of the obsessive thoughts bc that seems to be all I think about and am even having dreams of being late on the first day, I need to have all my clothes set up before tomorrow morning, I am almost on the verge of making a list in terms of ‘brush teeth, put on deodorant, bring backpack’ just to make sure I do everything, even though I know that probably won’t be an issue. I keep trying to talk myself into just thinking about getting thru tomorrow and how I am overthinking it and this is why I picked a Friday...but I don’t know. It’s not even about the job itself, it’s about the fact that I have been able to do whatever for the last 2-3 years while getting my MBA (online) and will now have structure which I think will be good, but is also freaking me out because I will be answering to someone.

The only anxiety symptom I get (besides racing heart) is dry heaving to the point I gag but **never throw up**. This only started spontaneously I'd say over a year ago. It's usually when I think about anything too much (wedding, hair cut, job interview, etc) that I feel nauseous and then begin to dry heave.

This is extremely embarrassing as a 27 year old male as I've never seen or heard anyone with this problem. And it's not something you can hide either since people notice sometimes when it happens. It usually subsides after 5-10 minutes and I calm down but those few minutes feels like hours. I've been unemployed for a little over a year and truth be told, I'm scared to even apply to jobs because I think what if I start gagging in an interview or at work?

This is extremely frustrating. I've always been an athlete on 2 different teams, college, and working and I was never like this. I don't know where this symptom came from but I wish it could go away. I went to a wedding last week and I was completely fine, but as soon as I had to greet the wedding party this gagging started again. I went quickly outside for some fresh air for it to pass and then I went back inside.

I've started going to bed earlier so I could get 7+ hours of sleep, I noticed I feel better than usual if I do. I was also planning on starting meditation.

Hello everyone!

I'm not sure that this is the right place to ask this but I'm super new to Reddit and I didn't know where else would be best.

I get really anxious when anything drug related is mentioned and I don't know why or how to stop it.

My boyfriend smokes weed, which is the only thing that hasn't flared up my anxiety, but he has recently taken acid and I've been really anxious about it.

I spoke to him about his safety and got as much information out of him as I could. I kept asking him the same questions over and over due to being so overly anxious about it to the point where he got really frustrated at me which is understandable imo. He was alright when he took it although he had a period of time when he didn't message for a few hours and both his phone and his friend's phone (also on acid) were off. That made it even worse.

I spoke to him before and acid is the limit - I don't want him doing anything else. I know it's his choice but if he decides to do it I'm walking out as it's affecting me a lot too. I love him very much but that's where I draw the line.

Every time I'm online and see a post about any kind of illegal drug I have to scroll past really quickly otherwise I get panic attacks.

As a back story that might help, I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 14, but the reason behind it had nothing to do with drug abuse. 

I just want it to stop. I don't want to be anxious every time he does it or any time it's mentioned. Any advice? Has anyone else experienced this?

I’m sure I’m going to have panic attacks there, probably even in the initial session. Should I inform them of this? How do I stop this from preventing me returning?

Also, if anyone with severe panic could tell me a happy story about CBT helping them that would be great too:)",Anxiety
1537,t3_djdpj3,Childhood experience causing anxiety,"When I was like 7/8 years old, I randomly had this urge to know what “making out” was. At the specific time this younger cousin was around. 

I briefly for one or two seconds stuck my tongue in my cousins mouth twice. Shortly after they ran out of the room and I forgot about it and went about my day and life

Until recently as an adult this memory pops up in my head and I feel awful. Thoughts of how could I do that and why would I do that. My cousin is 5 years younger than me and I never did anything like this after the fact or ever thought about doing something like that. 

Is this normal childhood experimentation that I’m putting my adult thoughts with? I just feel like such a disgusting weirdo.",Anxiety
1538,t3_djaitg,"I’m used to anxiety/depression, but for the last few weeks I’ve been in hardcore survival mode, and I’m so tired.","When I say “survival mode” I mean that every single day feels like a battle. I am barely making it. My goals each day are: get out of bed, make it to work, make it to 5, take a shower. That’s truly the most I can do. And sometimes I don’t shower. 

I tried therapy earlier this year, and saw a psychiatrist/tried medication, but it didn’t help and actually significantly added to my anxiety by being so expensive. I couldn’t afford to continue. 

At work I can’t focus. I’m sitting in my office paralyzed. I just can’t do it. I cannot do anything. I can’t leave because I’ve used my 5 sick days this year already. 

At night I lay in bed for hours trying to sleep. Telling myself *It’s OK, everything’s fine, just relax. You’re OK. It’s all OK. Just breathe.* It doesn’t work. I toss and turn for hours. 

I couldn’t sleep Monday night, slept 4 hours Tuesday night and 5 last night. I’m tired. My body aches. I feel like I might want to cry, but I’m too tired to even do that. 

I just don’t care anymore. I don’t know what the point of life is. I’m not going to kill myself, but working 9-5, barely scraping by, in $50k of debt from a degree I don’t use, having no time or money for passions/interests/hobbies... this isn’t life.

1539,t3_djdnyd,Anxiety about my therapy for anxiety,"My therapist whose is great I should say from the start did admit that she doesn't think I have OCD and maybe I don't but I feel like I do. She agrees I have obsessive patterns of thinking and thinks it and my anxiety are linked to other parts of my life including something that happened in my childhood and these obsessions stem from an inability to trust my own emotions. I don't necessarily disagree but I don't know I remember when I first sort of stumbled on the fact I might be OCD. I was dealing with or what I thought was HOCD and remember reading the story of a gay guy ub the closet with that of a HOCD sufferer and identified so much with the latter. 

I have had obsessive thoughts about hell, brain tumor, being secretly gay, being bi, having ALS and secretly being trans. And now a fear that I don't love my girlfriend.  I used to scratch, forcibly blink, and bite myself to ""remove the thoughts"" and I of course spent hours of worth of time trying to find answers online and comparing how I felt about this compared to this.

This all seems OCD. She doesn't deny I have anxiety issues/disorder. But not OCD and my only concern is if I an receiving proper treatment. So I'm anxiety over being treated for anxiety now, lol.",Anxiety

I am in a long distance relationship (we've met a few times, and speak every day on the phone/text - but we're not BF/GF as yet)  


Before I was exclusive with her, I had a one night stand with someone else, after hearing that girl was known to 'sleep around' I got huge HIV anxiety. Since then I've had a test (free on the NHS at the clinic, blood test but unsure what kind) at 6 weeks, and again at around 14 weeks (I think this one is 4th gen, tests for hiv 1+2 antibodies and p24 antigens).  


Both of these tests were negative, and most of the time I accept these results.  


However sometimes, especially when its close to me seeing her I get very anxious and I start to think the tests may not be so accurate.

1548,t3_diya1j,How to deal with severe free time anxiety?,"It sounds really dumb, I’m sure, but the past few months I’ve been dealing with a really bad flare up of symptoms I’ve had off and on all my life. I can’t decide what to do with my free time. 

I know it probably sounds arbitrary and ridiculous, but when I have time to myself without my girlfriend, I think of all the things I want to do and then end up forcing myself to do one, all the while feeling like I could be doing other things, worrying that I’ll regret not doing something else, and ultimately feeling only halfway into what I do end up do omg because I have a sense of almost obligation and I have trouble investing and being focused. 

As an example, I had a free evening last night. I’ve been wanting to watch a movie, but also wanting to read a book, and at the same time wanting to play a game. I sat for maybe 30 minutes trying to decide how to best maximize my time, until I finally watched a movie. I enjoyed it, but I also couldn’t stop thinking about how I maybe could’ve been enjoying my book more, and maybe I should’ve played a game since I may have less time to do that in the next couple of days. And then there’s the ever present thoughts of “why am I even doing this? Is this really worthwhile? Am I wasting my time?” And what’s worse, the next day, I may feel like “man, last night I wish I could’ve done this instead when I had the chance”. 

It even leads to more intrusive thoughts about my life in general and whether I’m bored with my relationship, bored with life, bored with my social situations, etc. I’ll see people I don’t know on social media doing things I’d love to be doing and think “I wish I was doing that with those people”. Totally crazy I know. 

It’s been manifesting as a need to hang out with friends too, because I feel like it’s something I really want to do, and when they can’t or the plans change, it makes me even more stressed. 

It’s really exhausting, and my medicines (buspar and trintellix) don’t seem to be helping.

1549,t3_djd5b4,Fear of Vaccines,"As a child, I was very scared of vaccines, and that carried on to today!

I know vaccines are so beneficial to me, but when I see the needle I immediately become fearful. I keep thinking about the moment the needle will pierce through my skin and am never quite ready for it to happen nor mentally “psyched.” I’ll worry about an upcoming vaccine for a long time. It’s safe to say that while I understand the need for vaccines and WANT to get them, they are one of my biggest fears so it’s more of a resignment to the fact that I need them than a want to get them.

I’ve tried a lot of things and changing my idea of vaccines, but when it was time to get a vaccine I had another bad experience from the pain, etc.

I wish I could just shut off my fear of needles when it was time for a vaccine! It’s all in my head but my fear is controlling me and I can’t seem to get rid of it even though I acknowledge that it’s ridiculous.

It feels like, I’m not quite ready for the big moment of perseverence to happen and I keep thinking about how I will persevere through it which just works me up even more. I see the needle and I just kind of internally go NOPE, then when I try to get back on track it doesn’t help. Plus the cleaning of the area before the injection makes the area feel vulnerable so it scares me even more to feel that vulnerability.

Idk if I did a good enough job explaining my issue, I’ll probably update this later adding more description. For now, any advice would really be appreciated!

During that time, there’s been several ups and downs, but nowadays it’s mostly good and I can see myself marrying her one day.

Now, the part where this gets complicated is during the bad times. There was a time once where it wasn’t going well with my girlfriend and I was starting to question the relationship. There were times where my mind would wander, and I’d start to think about what relationships with other girls would be like.

There was even a time where I got really close to a long term female friend, and I felt confused about whether she was flirting with me and how I felt about that. It made me really start to question my relationship. Nothing “physical” ever happened though.

1553,t3_dj2lps,Some tips for health anxiety,"This is from the perspective of someone who developed dormant anxiety in my teenage years which was triggered after a mushroom trip. Those tips I had to learn on my own and I really hope it helps someone else. Here goes:

-sit down, take a breather for a second

-you ARE gonna die. You aren't immortal, none of us are. This is the reality we all have to accept. It's the curse of consciousness

-accept that your body is 80% in autopilot. Which means you trying to take back control from a place you never had control of is a waste of time. Focus on the 20%.

-go see a doctor. Get yourself checked out. Google will 100% of the time make your anxiety worse

Okay now here are the actually helpful tips:

-DO NOT try to medicate it right away, even if a doctor prescribes you something. It's just a band aid that'll end up doing more harm than good. You may still have the power inside you to fix it.
(EDIT: what I mean is first try to see if you can fight it without resorting to medication first. But you are sure that medication is the last resort then go for it :) )

-consider natural supplements like relaxen and melatonin. The former will help during the day if it gets hard to control and melatonin for those sleepless nights. But don't abuse it since you'll build a tolerance.

-for me falling asleep meant anxious feeling would haunt me about 5 min before I fell asleep. Every night. I'd even get some very vivid dream like imagery popping into my head (which can get scary). A good trick is to accept those feelings and tell yourself ""there they are. That means I'm gonna fall asleep soon"". Which meant I started expecting them and even was looking forward to them. When I wasn't scared anymore the pre-sleep anxiety just stopped

-every time you start feeling anxious, tell yourself this mantra ""stop lying anxiety. You haven't killed me thus far, you aren't going to do it now.""

-treat your anxiety like a crying kid in the back of your mind.  Giving it attention feeds the anxiety (which is why it's so easy to spiral into a panic attack). Just like a capricious kid, you need to adopt a ""fuck it"" mentality. Even when alone, the satisfaction you get from ignoring it like a champ will help a lot

-practise mindfulness. This one it hard to explain but simply put: your brain, when it detects something's wrong, will go into ""hyper vision"" mode to try to figure out what the problem is. This is why every little symptom worries you. What you need to do is: 1. Look at the symptom. 2. Acknowledge it. 3. Let it go. A good mental trick is to think of it like if you are were a thrift shop with the most boring stuff in it. Once you master that technique you will be able to ignore the symptoms to a point where even the beggining of a panic attack will just wash over you like a wave on a rock. 

-it's important to have a support group (even one person is enough) but it's even more important not to abuse it. If you keep talking about your anxiety it keeps it alive. Remember, the whole point is to leave it behind.

-adopt the ""I'll worry about it when I get to it""mentality for everything in your life, not just the anxiety. This one is particularly hard but it's a fake it till you make type of deal. 

-live your fucking life. you only have the one. You won't be reincarnated into someone else and have another go at it. You need to figure what's important to you and pursue it. 

Anyways that's all I got. I might add to the post if some other tips come back to me. I love you all and good luck!

1555,t3_dj5gik,Perfectionism and Negative Self Talk,"So, i want to keep this as short as possible. But i believe ive struggled with negative self talk and low self esteem all my life. 

It came from when i was young, 8 or 9 that i had somehow convinced myself that I wasnt as smart as the other kids in class and that I was ugly and/or not as good looking as i should be. I wasnt really ever bullied in my life, and i was a decently smart kid, but my mind had somehow made up these lies that i believed. 

Fast forward, keeping these things in mind, i graduated university and am looking for my first job. Landed one finally with a small family owned company. Was really nervous because i always struggled with confidence as well. ""Will i be smart enough?"" ""Will i be good enough?"" ""Will they fire me if they think im stupid?"" Etc. These types of thoughts always running in my head. 

Now, the owner/boss was the most toxic guy ever. Nice during the interview, even gave my compliments on how detail oriented and how i was efficient and noticed flaws in his work that he didnt even notice. But, these were overshadowed by the negative comments that made no sense and negative talk is get. It was like jekyll and hyde with him. It was at home after the first day i discovered for the first time in my life what a panick attack was. Got one hour of sleep if that. This continued for the whole week. 

After a week, i couldnt take it anymore and quit. He proceeded to blame me for my anxiety. 

I then realized, after speaking to a professional that he was in the wrong. Still proceeded to blame myself. 

Fast forward to now, almost 2 yrs later, i am working in the family business as a tradesperson (wont say what for privscy reasons).

Now my current issues are dealing with perfectionism, have little to no confidence in trying something new, i am SO self critical of how i do things that its unhealthy. I also have a fear of failure. If i break something while working, or snap a bolt or something or cant fix something, i will dwell on it forever and feel like an absolute idiot. 


Like, if im taping up a wire, im literally sweating because i think im doing it wrong or im criticizing myself with every turn of the tape. Or if im screwing in a screw, ill be like ""See, you're so slow"" ""See the screwdriver slipped, you're not good enough at this"" or ""He's watching you work, better not mess up"". And more. 

I am also afraid of being judged by people. If someone is watching me, ill constantly be thinking about what they may be thinking of me, in a negative manner, even though no one has ever said anything to me. Only good things have ever been said. But its like my mind ignores all that and only filters in the negatives to me. 

I get scared of what someone might say to me, so i criticize myself to the point of anxiety. Or, if there is another tradesperson talking to me, i am immediately threatened because i feel i know nothing compared to them and that if i talk, i may come across as a complete idiot that knows nothing.

I have had many MANY positive experiences where i have done and accomplished things that are SO POSITIVE, but my minds negates them and only lets me focus on the negatives. Same with compliments, i take em, but dont embrace them. I only embrace what I THINK i did wrong, even though that may be nothing. 

TLDR: I have low self esteem, low self confidence, and am extremely self critical when i dont need to be, fear of failure and fear of being judged and i want to get out of it. 

Anyone have any tips on how to embrace positivity in my life? Embrace that when i do a job, i am doing a good job? And how to stop being so damn critical about everything i do?

1558,t3_djc7ck,Trouble eating and drinking alcohol post break-up,"Me \[22M\] and my ex-girlfriend \[22F\] broke up a year and a month ago and ever since then I've had struggles eating and drinking alcohol. Due to us being in the same group of friends, I've never completely gotten over her and I think I still have feelings for her. The relationship is a bit messed up because we've never really stopped communicating; we basically message each other every single day and just recently we were on a small group holiday and we made out and never really talked about it. It also feels like she's completely over me emotionally and she has definitely handled the breakup way better than I have.

Ever since the breakup, I have had trouble eating and drinking alcohol in a social setting, especially when she's around. It was the worst the first month after the breakup, where I could never eat a full meal. Just recently, me and my friends (including her) went out for dinner and I could barely touch the food because of the nausea and anxiety and I asked the waitress to put the food in a box for me and ate it with ease when I got home. I also cannot drink (alcohol) as much as I was able to prior to the breakup anymore. In fact, it's physically impossible for me to get drunk or close to drunk, especially when she's around.

Another thing that's been happening is that I can feel my stomach starting to get uncomfortable hours before a night out. For example, we plan to go out for dinner or for drinks and the mere thought of going to these places immediately upsets my stomach. I've sometimes vomited before even drinking the alcohol, which leads me to think that it's a mental thing.

Two things that help me eat normally are smoking pot and keeping my mind busy enough to not think about her or anything that could possibly upset my stomach. My stomach has always been very subject to my thought, I also have trouble eating the day before an exam, but it's not as bad because I know it's temporary.

 I guess the most obvious solution would be to stop all contact with her but this is impossible as we share the same group of friends. I also low-key feel like I have to talk and give her attention to reduce the possibilities of being replaced by someone else (the thought of this happening also upsets my stomach). 

I consider myself a mentally stable person, but my stomach says otherwise? Should I visit a psychologist or do you think I can get through this alone? (it's been over a year now) Feel free to ask any questions.",Anxiety

1560,t3_dj8z35,"Never posted here before. Needing reassurance, maybe some advice","I need to vent a little. I called into work today. I’m really, really not doing well anxiety wise. I didn’t sleep last night, I finally called in at 4 when it became apparent that I wouldn’t be sleeping (I’m an RN, have to get up by 5). My stomach is upset and my migraine (have had since I was 2) is back. Both of those started yesterday morning. My heart feels like it is pounding, tachycardic, I can’t stop shaking, and my muscles in my legs and butt ache from clenching them all night. My anxiety is so bad the past few months, with nothing consciously bothering or upsetting me at all, so now that something is bothering me, it’s totally out of control. A little info on that in a minute. I cried this morning (I really, really rarely cry) because I didn’t want my husband to leave me to go to work, even though I knew he had to. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t had a “flare up” this bad in a few years.

So about me and what’s going on. I’m a 30 year old female, been diagnosed with GAD and major depressive disorder since the 4th grade. I’ve been hospitalized in inpatient psych twice, once when I was 16, and again when I was 23 I think. First time was suicide attempt, second was just ideation. I don’t feel that’s particularly relevant to now because the depression side is under pretty good control with meds.  I take Prozac 60 mg daily, and I have since that last hospitalization several years ago. I also take Buspar 15 mg BID, and I’ve been on that probably 2 to 3 years. I used to take Xanax as needed, but I’ve been off that for about 2 years, ever since I don’t have insurance coverage and had to stop seeing my psychiatrist. I’m fortunate in that my dad is an MD and can write my prescriptions as long as they aren’t controlled substances, or I’d be really SOL.

I’ll be as brief as I can, but what’s going on now that’s thrown me into this exacerbation has to do with a dog rescue I’m heavily involved with. Though I take care of people for work, animals have been my passion for as long as I can remember. For 3 1/2 years now, I have volunteered and fostered with a tiny rescue in the rural south. Among other things, I help manage the website and process adoption applications, do physical work at the rescue when I can, and like I said I foster. I have also become very close with the founder in this time. A bit over a month ago, the city council decided to shut the rescue down, on the grounds that there is an ordinance of 4 dogs per household. This law has been on the books since 1991 and never enforced, despite the town (population 1200) being well aware of what we do, and in fact dropping dogs off on MANY occasions (no animal control there). This is a well-respected 501c3 certified non profit. Again, this is in rural Arkansas, in a town of 1200, and the real reason for everything is that there is a councilman with a personal vendetta against the rescue’s founder. I won’t get into that here, but to say the “good ol’ boy system” is firmly in place. Despite online petitions, news coverage, and two city council meetings with great turnout, the council won’t budge. On Tuesday, we were given a 14 day extension to the original 30 days, but the council was clear that there will be no further extension. Miraculously, we have moved 25+ dogs since this began, but there are still about 10 more to go, 5 of whom are heartworm positive and cannot be adopted or travel across state lines until they are treated (a fairly lengthy process). We must have the dogs relocated by November 1. Fosters and adopters are not forthcoming. The city’s plan for any excess dogs remaining is to turn them out on the streets. Obviously we cannot allow that, but what can we do? We have no choice but to relocate the rescue, but that will take time and money we don’t have.

Sorry for rambling, when I really came here to talk about my anxiety, but this is the situation that has thrown my already fragile mental state into overdrive. This is obviously something I’m extremely passionate about, and it is weighing on me heavily. I have the pressures of being a full time charge nurse on a very busy unit, a mother, and a wife on top of that. My husband only works 20 hours a week and makes minimum wage.

A distinct and all too familiar feeling I know is getting crazy nervous when someone you like isn’t responding to you quick enough to the point where you assume you’ve done something wrong and they don’t like you as a person anymore. Couldn’t the things I have just described be part of BPD or could GAD also lead someone to behave this way? I think my anxiety makes me feel everything so intensely and I feel like I have 50 tabs open in my mind at all times and that it’s too easy to get stuck on a negative tab and spiral into a web of dark thoughts.

1565,t3_dj475f,How can I stop thinking as if everything revolves around me?,"Now to be clear, by “revolves around me” I don’t mean it in the usual sense but like any time someone acts a certain (usually negative) way or does/doesn’t do something I assume it’s about me and start over thinking the fuck out of it and I don’t know how to stop. Like yeah I can just try to stop thinking about it but then it’s just sitting there on the edge of my mind until I give in and start overthinking again.

How the fuck do I stop that? I’ll start worrying that someone I’ve been really good friends with for years is starting to get annoyed by me because they aren’t responding to my texts very much one day. Or they decide they don’t want to go to a party and my dumbass thinks they must not like hanging out with me or something, and remember this is someone I’ve been really good friends with for several years.

Another example is when someone is quiet around me I start thinking they must not like me and not want to talk to me. When in reality they’re probably just enjoying sitting there and chilling and just don’t have anything to say. 

And if I hang out with someone that I’m not really close with and the day/night/whatever doesn’t END on a positive note, I will worry for the next two days or so about if they hate me. It doesn’t have to end on a negative note for my mind to start doing this, it just has to end on something that doesn’t reassure me that they like hanging out with me.

1568,t3_dj6h05,How to start enjoying life after escaping emotional abuse and financial ruin?,"Hi all,

I’m posting my current struggle here in the hope there are some people who experienced the same, got past it and will be able to give me some pointers. 

I’ll try to keep it as short as possible my apologies should I fail miserably. 

I grew up as the black sheep in a narcissistic family. Apart from being blamed for everything and never being good enough, I somehow was always responsible for fixing all the mistakes of any family member. 
After almost 30 years of this I met me wife (very similar background) and we broke away from our families together. 
Throughout this separation and our recovery from it we went through a bad financial spot were we could barely make ends meet, were on the verge of being homeless for several years and developed severe stress related medical issues. 
After a lot of fighting the good fight we overcame most of it, have a wonderful relationship, are doing great from a financial perspective and our outlook on the future has never been so bright. 

However, ever since the need for surviving decreased and was replaced by the need for starting to live, I’m feeling extremely anxious. 
I’m getting panic attacks, struggle with extreme IBS and can’t seem to enjoy life out of a fear of letting my guard down and possibly losing it all. 
After reaching everything I wanted, I’m left goalless and without a clear direction that gives me meaning. All things seem so trivial and superficial. 
I just feel I need a fight for an all absorbing cause to feel better and in lack of that I’m completely breaking down and start to imagine that ever little ache or pain is life threatening. 

Therapy isn’t doing anything and it’s starting to really weigh on me. 
Whatever I do just don’t seem to be able to properly relax and enjoy the moment after it ends.

1570,t3_djb9f3,Sometimes physical contact makes me feel sick,"Hiya, I'm Babs I'm 21 and this is my first post to this subreddit. I've had really bad anxiety and depression for around ten years or so and I've been experiencing this for just about the same amount of time, perhaps even longer. 

 So I've noticed that sometimes I can't stand to have anyone touch me, hug me, ask for a hug or anything like that. Just out of the blue and not even when I'm feeling particularly bad

 When I do get touched I get this sick and almost cramping feeling in my stomach, almost like the kind of feeling you get when you get cat called, kinda like guilt and disgust mashed into a whole new, more awful feeling that makes you want to run inside and never be seen again. It makes me feel like I have to go scrub my skin and go into hiding wherever they've made contact. It honestly really really scares me to have people touch me sometimes. 

I've never gotten that feeling with my boyfriend or my friends before. The more gentle the contact, the worse I feel and I have no idea what's up with that. I'm not a germaphobe, nor am I always this on edge about human contact.

It doesn't happen all the time, or with any select people. I can go and hug my mum one day with no problems but on another day I couldn't even stand the thought of it. 

So, I was wondering if maybe someone else had ever experienced this kinda thing before? Or if anyone knew of anything I could do to help it? Or even what this is? I'm getting really tired of feeling like I have to shove people away from me when all they're doing is showing me affection.

1574,t3_dj2zfz,"Is there a name for ""bipolar anxiety,"" where my anxiety is non-existent but then suddenly becomes unbearably bad?","So at this present moment, I feel no anxiety whatsoever. I feel completely fine, and thinking about things in my life - my health, my plans for the future, my friends and family - does not cause me any panic or stress whatsoever.

But, I have this issue where my anxiety can be triggered by an external event and it can literally destroy me in an instant and last for weeks. My issue is with academics; when I'm in a class, I need to feel like I have some idea of what's going on or have some way to succeed.

If I feel completely lost, I get anxious about the class, but when I say anxious, I mean the following: for weeks, I will not eat enough food and lose several pounds, I will get \~2 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky, I will lock myself in my dorm and sob, and I will think seriously about suicide. Things I didn't care about before - how many friends I have, what people think of me, the meaning of life - will suddenly stress me out and cause an existential crisis. I cannot express enough that *I go from a perfectly normal person to a highly depressed, highly anxious, low-functioning human being and all it takes is ONE CLASS where I have no idea what's going on.*

Here's the thing too: my fears are totally unfounded. I have a 3.93 GPA. I have never gotten anything below a B+ and I go to a top 20 university in the United States. All it takes is that I perceive a class as being difficult and that I am lost, and I can't handle it anymore. I go haywire.

Throughout college I've had to navigate around this. I used to be studying Computer Science (and still wish I had the mental strength to pursue it), but I reached the beginning of my fourth semester and had a complete meltdown. My family and I decided I switch to something easier - Economics - and this put me at ease for another 3 semesters. Then, I by chance took an econ class (my last core class I needed) with a professor who was unbelievably bad and gave an unbelievable amount of work, and I completely panicked again. The solution was simply to drop the course, despite this putting me in a tricky spot having to take it in my last semester.

After I made these moves, I went from suicidal to perfectly fine. What do you call this? Where an external event threatens some part of my subconscious so much that I become majorly mentally ill? Right now, I think back to these events and wonder how I let myself get so worked up. I sit here with my now-normal brain and say ""why can't you just, I don't know, wait around and see how the course goes? Or just accept that it's ridiculously hard and try your best anyway?"" I try and convince myself that this is all a mistake and that I could go back into Computer Science no problem, but I know it's a lie; I am one class away from a collapse at all times.

tl;dr - when a class makes me feel lost and confused, I go from perfectly normal and happy to near-suicidal with anxiety. I have never heard of this ""binary anxiety"" in anyone else and I want to know if there are others who have had this experience",Anxiety

1582,t3_dj9kst,A simpler solution to anxiety,"From my study of psychology, psychotherapy, biology, buddhism and neuroscience  and personally diagnosed with ""generalized anxiety disorder"",

Anxiety is pain and either the mind trying to escape it or thinking without being aware of the pain. 

What's the solution then? Acceptance of it. Trigger it. Embrace it. Exposure. Not hours of therapy and medication.

Why not medication? The medication will quiet your nervous system in a sense but your nervous system will adjust to the dose so you need higher and higher amounts.  Not to mention side effects and withdrawal(Lisa ling's benzos documentary)

Just like war, this(hours of therapy and medication) is also driven by money. Big pharma and the countless stories I've read on here of people meeting with therapists but still experiencing anxiety. Not to mention cycling through therapists.


Toughness, confidence works as well(both forms of acceptance). Just look at Trump. He for sure is a narcissist and is very self centered but I bet you put anybody else in his shoes and the amount of scrutiny and criticism he's under and the amount of stress associated with that job, they would be experiencing a lot of anxiety",Anxiety

She’s a wonderful person, honestly,...but her anxiety is frustrating. And, as a friend, I feel awful for being annoyed and frustrated with her. She asks so many questions, typically to do with our assignments. And a lot of the time it’s to do with really trivial stuff. Like, there’s this one time she asked about **50 questions** about my class. And she was asking these in the library WHILE I WAS TRYING TO STUDY. I tried to subtly get her to stop, but it wasn’t working. 

For example, I recently met up with another friend and she asked me these questions today:

1.	Are you close with her?
2.	since when did you become close?
3.	who initiated the hang out? She or you?
4.	did you plan through messaging or in real life? 

Which imo, are really unnecessary questions. But I’ve got to deal with it every time I’m with her, which is often.

I have OCD + autism, so I have some oddities to the way I do things, but it's never prevented me from being a hard worker and doing things right.

I always arrived 15 minutes early to the fish and chips shop, never called in sick, stayed late to finish the things I was doing and never asked to be paid for the extra hours. I just wanted to be helpful. They called me stupid, cut my hours to less than half of what they were after I went on holiday, and just generally made it really stressful for me to be there. I worked the shift by myself, and just had the worst time whenever I was there.

I have GAD, and social anxiety, but mostly just really bad GAD. I am always at least a little anxious, and because of all the other things I have going on, I don't handle people yelling at me or putting lots of pressure on me very well. I get really physically sick whenever I get anxious, and have panic attacks because I panic about getting sick. Every single day that I had work, I would get super sick.

I thought that I sucked at my job, and that I should be grateful my bosses were putting up with me. I blamed the way I was for the mistakes I occasionally made, which were unacceptable in my bosses eyes. I started believing that I would never be able to work because my anxiety was just too bad, and I got too stressed out and rushed because of my anxiety.

I have no money to pay the mechanic. I went to open a line of credit but they are sending it in the mail. I dont have that long. I get my next paycheck next Friday and I wont even have money to get gas to go to work with my other car which the payment is due on soon.

All these unexpected expenses just drained everything now I dont even have the card I got approved for on hand to feed my family... 

I'm trying to focus in my job which has a lot of moving parts. But I cant stay focused and I feel like a useless piece of shit....

I dont mean to complain I just feel so hopeless right now...

I even thought of killing myself so my fam could get life insurance money... But apparently I'm not worth a good amount that would pay off the debts that stacked up these last few weeks....
So that isn't even an option...

it would be the first in-person job i have (that is, if i get it), and i'm also worried about transportation. i don't drive, and leaving the house alone absolutely terrifies me. i already calculated how i would be getting there (there's a train stop right by my house, and it makes a stop 15 minutes walking distance from the business) but i'm still horrified about going out alone.

has anyone had any similar experiences in terms of impostor syndrome and fear of leaving the house? and if so, how did you guys combat them or at least make the anxiety associated with them easier to handle. i'm not currently on any medication, but my psychologist suggested i should get on some kind of meds.",Anxiety

   It started a few months ago,there is a girl who I like and I think that I hurt her but that was not intentional.I am feeling bad about it and can't do anything about it because she is with someone else now and in the past too similar situation happened and I felt bad about it and wanted to apologize and it's the same this time. But doing so would seem like I am trying on her. But that is not true at all.I am feeling bad about it and want to apologize really bad.I have had this guilt feeling for a long time and this just adds on to it.
  I can't really talk to friends about it as I get emotional when talking about it and so I try to be normal around them as if nothing has happened and suppress my emotions and due to this I come out as an asshole. The whole thing has created a fucked up situation for me and I can't even talk about it and without talking I can't even stay sane and it is driving me crazy. And this has happened in the past as well. Feels like I am stuck in a loop.

I sat down at my desk trying to calm myself down but everything i tried didnt work. I didnt want to eat any food  but i had to force myself otherwise my grandparents would have been on my case about me not eating. No kidding, it took me nearly 3 hours to finish just a damn pie i heated up. 

To top it all off, i also had to endure watching a couple of episodes of Unbelievable on Netflix  these episodes made my anxiety far worse where i ended up feeling sick from eating and i was so close to tears. My emotions were a complete mess by this stage.

1607,t3_dj2ciq,A small victory,"TL;DR: actually found a real life use for mindfulness

Tips: 
-practise mindfulness, you won't know it works until it actually does

-if you're having health anxiety, a good trick is to tell yourself to let your body go back to autopilot. You do that by simply observing the process until you get bored/forget about it

So back in july i took an irresponsibly high dose of mushrooms which triggered some pretty rough anxiety and panic attacks (wrote some posts about it some time ago). 
The following months I became hyper aware of every bodily function that had to do with my breathing, heart rate, body temperature and my brain. I truly felt like the mushrooms brought to light the fact that we as humans have in fact very little control of our body and most of it is actually in autopilot. I was desperately trying to gain back control and therefore spiralled pretty fast into suicidal thoughts. 
To me, life wasn't worth living if my body was in a constant state of either fight or flight or depersonalization.

There's a lot more to it but i wanna stick to the positive.

So in august I went to see a doctor and she told me that i should try meditation.
In desperation I tried it. Worked once but didn't help much, or so i thought. 
Until today.
I was in my bed when i felt the wave of anxiety coming in. Usually I'd sit up, clench my fist. Scramble for my phone to put on some meditation music and try to convince myself not to take the lorazepam the doc prescribed (I haven't touched it since i bought it), but this time I just.. let it happen. 
It washed over me, got to the peak where I could feel i might get a seizure (anxiety has common symptoms with epilepsy), then it stopped, my heart rate slowed down, and i was back to the normal ""anxiety simmering in the back of my head"" state. 
See, that thing where you have to be an observer of your own self but detached from it, and that meditation technique where you let your thought come and go as they please but without interacting with them, that's what it was for.
I know this isn't some revolutionary thing. But I'm really glad I was able to win one battle for once.",Anxiety

My anxiety stops me from making friends, new jobs--it's even stopping me from starting new hobbies like streaming and making vids which I've always been interested in. I feel trapped inside my own head. no matter what I tell myself, what the therapist says to me, and the meds I'm on. The three different prescriptions made me feel even worse being on after 7 months. And I felt even worse getting off of the meds. I'm too scared to do anything. Going to therapy is nerve wrecking. Every. Single. Time. Opening up to a stranger about the embarrassing fears you have. I can't even call a suicide hotline. I have a fear of calling. Yikes

I've done 3 job interviews and was 2/3 successful. The first job interview I was so freaked out, that my left eye lost partial vision for 6 minutes. I stuttered a lot, but I got the job though. I thought I could finally relax, But then everyday I was anxious to go to work. The gut feeling walking through the front doors everyday. For no reason. Everyday for 1 year. Until, I just couldn't do it anymore. I tried so badly. I want to succeed. But that gut wrenching feeling and panic everyday drained my mental health. I am a mute. Always to myself. Too scared to speak up. Kept asking myself why? Why won't it go away? There's nothing wrong happening... Going insane hating myself. 

My anxiety is holding me back in life. I hate it so much. It's uncontrollable. No matter what I tell myself. The reality that the only person to blame for my laziness and lack of progression is... Myself.

 I don't want to use any excuses. No matter how much I've been exposing myself and trying to get over it, it just gets worse... 

Is this just who I am? 
It feels like I'm coming to terms that this will be the rest of my life? And I don't think I can handle it... 

Now, like a bad heartbreak, I'm waiting it out. Waiting out if my anxiety will just pass. And I'll be able to live my life. I don't know what else to do. I don't even enjoy the things I like anymore like video games or movies. Brain keeps telling me I'm wasting time. I'm wasting my life. Now I am just laying in bed waiting for it to get better.

Not a problem but for whatever reason during my first typography class i went to the bathroom as I'd done the first class. Now other people had left to go to the bathroom in both classes. But for whatever reason she cornered me outside the classroom and just went off on me about leaving. I wasn't gone for an hour it was a 3 minute bathroom run. And then someone else left immedietly after me and she didn't say a word to them. After that shes just taken to hating on me given my history with christians im stuck being anxious the whole class which then becomes a self perpetuating setting me up to get yelled at and embaressed. I've hung on to this point in the session but I can't do it anymore. I really love my major and its sucks. I can't handle it and I'm dropping the class. I'm genuinely afraid of my professor because shes aggrevating a really fresh wound for me. I'm outwardly masculine and I'm ftm but not out in the class and I can't help but think she's doing this because of my presentation because I'm the only one she's taking this aggression out on. I've never had a professor in college corner me outside of a classroom for leaving before and I've been struggling to get basic stuff right. Like getting assignments in and done correctly which I've never struggled with in the past, ever. 

I'm so frustrated with myself and my past and just the fact she's a christian and I'm trans. I know its my fault and that presenting this way brings that on and if I didn't have all these previous negative experiences I'd be fine.

I was so ready to finally have a major that made sense and start on track with my life and I'm failing again. I don't know why I expected anything different. 

I'm supposed to be in class now but I realized I got another assignment wrong in what she wanted and I just walked out. I'm waiting for my break and then I'm going to sneak in and hopefully get my things and leave. I'll withdrawl from both class because honestly I can't handle this professor this semester too much of what I'm dealing with is fresh and I'm too weak to handle this shit.

1616,t3_dj5twd,Muscle contractions/siezure-like anxiety attack after endurance exercises,"Wondering if anyone has experinced this here, I recently started trying being more active to help reduce anxiety and lose a few pounds. I took up walking in the morning and the gym in the afternoon every day. 

Yesterday was day 5, I did endurance/core exercises and some bicep/tricep weightlifting.

I was almost done at an hour mark
and started feeling my heart rate going up, I went to the bathroom to get some cold water on me and relax, but after about a minute I started having extreme muslce contractions tied to a full blown pa jc attack.

Usually I'd fear a heart attack in this moment but I noticed the contracting muscles are exactly those that I worked out that day.

My complete abdomen, lowe back, and sides went numb, in extreme pain, and extreme contractons in a SECOND. I was lied down given some sugar and cold water and then it spread to my hands, completely paralyzed, and straight like an arrow. I could move everything still, but barely. 

Then it went to my throat and I could barely speak and open my jaw. 

I was given a chill pill and about 10 minutes later everything disspiated to about 10%. I tried standing up but almost felt down. Extreme dizziness and now headache. All body tingling.

I lie back down and start to calm down. About 10 minutes more later it all comes back this time affecting my chest/lungs as well. I thought this is it. At this point the ER was called and by the time I got there most of these things were gone. 

They gave me more chill pills to relax. Did an EKG (heart test) and took my blood pressure. Both great results, like nothing happened.

I was later really afraid because I suspected an epilepsy or similar attack. I never had this before, but turns out it unlikely because I didn't have any other symptoms that are always there when it's epilepsy.

I find comfort in the fact that it all started with all the muscles I worked out hard just minutes before the attack.

Does anyone here have any experience with this? I plan on going through all kinds of additional testing to see if there's any other disorder.

I don't want to talk about the causes, I need to know what happens to me, and please i  really need a solution. Recently, something really bad happened in my  life. Maybe one of the most difficult challenge I have to pass through.  When it happened to me, I was surpassed by the emotion, my heart was  beating, I couldn't focus on anything esle but the  event, I didn't want to talk to anybody, I felt something in my head,  can't say if it was a big hot or a big cold, maybe both. I think that  was anxiety. I lived with that feeling for some days, like four or five  and that was a torment. I had to quit my job because i really couldn't get up at 5am and get ready to work.

Finally, I talk a little bit with my mom, explained to her what happened ect  (I didn't eat during that moment, so I told her at first that I had  nausea...). Since I talk to her, I was really really better, I won't  lie, I was still sad af, can't really talk to a lot of people ect, ect, but really I felt better.

Anything  else completed my state, like I'm interested in lucid dream, and during  my ""anxiety"" period I could not remember my dreams, but now I can, I  wanted to focus on that, dunno in order to change my mind. I can't  explain it, but the feeling I described at first is coming back, my  heart is beating, maybe a little bit painful ect....

For  now it's not a big deal, I went outside, watched a snail, breath as  much as possible and prepared a cup of tea (why?? I have really no  idea), but during these days I talked at first, the pain was so big, I  was so bad that i wanted to kill myself. I'm really serious, i just wanted to end my life because it was too painful, that heart feeling, that constant focus on the events ect, ect...

1623,t3_dizkt7,Why won’t the panic stop?,"A lot my anxiety is health based.

It was never officially diagnosed as I had to stop treatment due to losing insurance. I have however been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. So the former is a real possibility. 

Anyway, to my current situation: I work late nights at a Halloween event and I have to dress business casual. Most of the time I wear skirts or dresses as their easy to move in and it’s been warm. I have been eaten alive by mosquitoes. 
I thought nothing of it until my coworker posted an article that mosquitoes 2 blocks away tested positive for some crazy disease. The symptoms were fever, nausea, brain swelling, and some other terrifying things. 

I cannot get it off my mind. My heart has been racing for almost an hour and I’m trying not to cry because I’m visiting with company. All of this has given me a headache and I can’t stop connecting it with that disease. I’m over thinking everything my body is feeling and doing. 

I’m so tired of feeling crazy and being terrified of everything. I just want to be “normal”. Or at the very least brush it off and not worry about it. 
I need to find an outlet. Most medications I’ve tried made me violently ill, and the only time I was able to cope was when I used to use THC/CBD or when I had therapy. My company drug tests and I can’t afford therapy at the moment so all I can do is just pour my feelings and hope someone can tell me that I’ll be okay, because I really don’t feel like I am.

It was just good to have someone to talk to that wasn't trying to just make me feel better or just wants whats best for me. The therapist let me talk and then they explained the actual processes of how to rationally think. It felt great to have a goal in mind on what to do before the next appointment. I felt more organized with my thoughts even though I'm not 'better'. 

I even felt progress after my first session. I'm thinking about things a different want and she helped me realize that a lot of people go through it to some extent.

1633,t3_dj1b93,How my anxiety has helped me more than it’s hurt me,"This is my first post on this subreddit, after reading through several post I haven’t really seen anyone with a similar situation, basically everyone has very similar symptoms though, needless to say. But I was rid of anxiety for a good 2 years, and mind you I’m only 17, and suddenly out of nowhere about 4 weeks ago, boom! massive panic attack, my first one. And since than I’ve had about eight, four really bad ones where I genuinely would’ve jumped off a bridge if I had the chance that’s how badly I wanted it to be over, I’ve managed to deal with the panic attacks recently, I know when there coming and I know what to do when they do. But what I’ve realized it that this constant anxiety stemmed from that one panic attack, it was so horrifying I couldn’t stop thinking about it, and the only reason I had the second and third and fourth bad ones was because I was thinking about the one prior, I was worrying about worrying as Alan Watts would say, and for the first three weeks, I couldn’t function, it was like this anxiety I had worked so hard to let flow through me instead of take me over had suddenly punched me in the back of my head, almost as if my brain was trying to tell me something. I don’t get out often, I don’t get exercise even though I could, I don’t function and do things, I don’t try...even though I should, that sudden outburst felt like my brain screaming and crying for help because I wasn’t listening, I eat like shit, I’m lazy, I don’t get out at all, and I’m slowly turning all that around, I’m taking supplements and changing my diet to a more vegan diet, much healthier than how I was eating before, I’m going on runs, I’m going out with my friends any chance I get, which is only once a week but it’s a start, but in the long Tun my anxiety was helpful I’m telling me that I’ve got to change things up ASAP, I tend to ramble on with these, but...anyway, I hope this gets out and I can hear some other perspectives.",Anxiety
1634,t3_dj0av3,I went to my first Halloween house party and I had fun,"I’m on Mobil so sorry for the spelling mistakes. I was invited to a Halloween party the other night by one of my sister in laws friends who she works with. The thing is I have it built up in my head that all her friends hate me and think I’m ugly and weird even know we haven’t really talked, but you know, that’s what overthinking does. I’m still not sure if my sister in law asked if I could come or if I was invited by the host of the party. I really did not want to go. I was thinking of every possible scenario in my head, kept thinking that I would mess it up somehow and everyone would hate me and think I’m weird and that I would be by myself the whole party leaning up against a wall or something. 

So after overthinking every possible scenario, I made a excuse and told my sister in law that I was tired and did not want to go. This upset her a great deal. She knows that I have a anxiety disorder and has been trying to help me go out of my comfort zone and to try to help me get a girlfriend and make some friends, which I am thankful for. I bit the bullet and decided to go. It was a clown party so we got dressed up with makeup and headed out and...
I actually had a good time. None of the bad things I thought in my head happened. I had some drinks and smoked some weed with a cool group of people and did some talking. We talked about work and games and stuff. It was definitely not as bad as I made it out to be in my head. 

I give myself props and a pat on the back for going out of my comfort zone. I seem to have a problem with my looks that gives my anxiety. I have been called ugly my whole life and think that people who are attractive look down on unattractive people. I couldn’t rap my head around why I was invited to a party with such beautiful people.

My anxiety is that I get panic attacks when I'm around people like in a bus and in pretty insecure about myself. I don't feel anxious before I go outside or want to do something. I don't have a problem sozializing.
I even got a couple job offers before I really applied for it because they liked me so much.

 I had really good grades in school and after I graduated under the 10 best of the region it all went down. My father has a borderline personality disorder which made it really hard to get along with him (and is probably the trigger of my anxiety). I went to college after that and when  I was there I had a feeling in the back of my mind that told me to go. To go somewhere safe. I ignored that and made a couple friends. After a while the itching in the back of my head went louder and I began sweating in the winter and shaking shortly after that I had the feeling that I don't get enough air. That was my first panic attack.

Now I'm at a point where I was denied by doctors to get medication and on the waiting list for some other and I go rarely outside. A couple times a month and every time I get home again I lock myself into my room shaking make a pillow fortress and cry until I fall asleep.

1650,t3_dj39o8,Anxiety vs. Adderall,"Hello, 

I'm new to this forum, even though I have struggled with anxiety for about 5 years now, give or take. To give some background information: I'm a 21 year old, female, attending University in IL. I was recently just finally diagnosed with Narcolepsy w/o Cataplexy (Type 2 Narcolepsy). 

I started feeling the affects of anxiety at about the same time as my symptoms of narcolepsy really started to become apparent. I can't say for sure if the anxiety is a byproduct of my narcolepsy, but either way they both started deeply affecting my life around my freshmen/sophomore years of high school. Since then, their severity have only gotten progressively worse. Causing me to almost have to drop out of school, which is what initially pushed me to go see a doctor since this was clearly impacting my life in a negative way. 

Although, I've known for years now that I have anxiety. I always just wanted to try to handle it on my own. Hence why I have not been formally diagnosed/medicated for it. I also was aware that something was off with my sleeping habits, but obviously I struggled with it for years until finally this year, I just got diagnosed with narcolepsy. With being diagnosed, I was prescribed to take 20 mg Adderall Xr. 

So this brings me to my real question: For those of you that suffer from Anxiety, have you ever been prescribed Adderall to combat the effects? 
Or someone tried it and realized it helped clear up your thoughts/anxiousness? 

I know what I'm asking probably sounds irrational, since Adderall helps produce energy, thus making you more anxious/jittery. But I'm asking this, because although it's too soon to tell the long term affects it will have on my anxiety; in the short term, it has actually helped me a lot. Now I'm not saying it's a cure by any means, but the Adderall makes me feel more confident in what I'm saying, due to the fact that I can actually organize my thoughts and formulate a sentence correctly without having to worry about messing it up or getting overall anxious which makes me lose my train of thought. 

Just want to hear if anyone has had a similar experience or has had an experience with comparing these two things at all. 

Thanks in advance!!",Anxiety
1651,t3_dj1710,*TRIGGER WARNING* This is how I feel with my anxiety and depression and nothing is helping.,"There’s so much tension, like something is building. But building to what? There’s no end. It just continuously builds and builds and it feels like your body is going to explode. I’m so exhausted, even though I sleep 12+ hours a day. I’m so exhausted, and yet i feel that if I don’t move my fingers or toes or feet then I will surely explode. My head hurts. My stomach hurts. I always have to use the restroom. I always feel nauseous or that my head is spinning. I feel the pressure on my chest and the shortness of breath. Why can’t I breathe? I’m taking a breath but no oxygen is filling my lungs. I feel the dizziness and helplessness. Am I broken? Is there too much wrong with me? Why isn’t anything working? What if it never gets better? What if I’m actually dying? What if there’s something more to this than just anxiety? Am I dying? 
I want it to stop. All of it. It’s so much. It’s so. much. Please just make it stop. My arms and legs are burning and I’m sweaty and no matter how hard I cry, no matter how much air I let escape my lungs, no matter how many tears there are, it still hurts the same. There’s no relief. It’s the feeling of being empty but filled up at the same time. It’s the feeling of being numb, yet feeling everything all at once. It’s wanting it all to end, but not wanting to die. It’s not knowing what to do. The feeling that things will never be fixed. Feeling like you’re losing everything and everyone. It’s so heavy.   

It’s losing all your friends because you don’t have the energy to see them. It’s losing the respect of your family because you no longer fit their image. It’s being 19 and not being able to finish high school because everything is just so much and you can’t focus or find the energy or motivation to do it. It’s quitting your job because your boss sees you as lazy because you get “sick” too often and you’re too afraid to tell him you’re not “physically sick.” It’s not having the motivation to exercise or cook a healthy meal. It’s not having the energy to clean your house. It’s not having the motivation or energy to get yourself in the shower. It’s dreading getting ready for the day and getting in the car. It’s being terrified that you’re going to lose control. It’s being terrified of yourself. It’s being terrified that your own brain is turning on you. It’s not knowing who you are anymore. Am I my mental illness? What even defines me?   

I’ve been to therapy. I’ve tried different medications, and I’m taking some currently. I’ve had so many doctor’s visits. I’ve talked with different therapists. I’ve used text hotlines. I’ve talk to just about everyone. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve had issues with suicidal ideation in the past, but I’m not suicidal. I’m just so helplessly depressed and anxious. 

This is the worst it’s ever been (minus the suicidal stuff). I’ve been diagnosed with major depression, severe anxiety, ADD, and PTSD.

1652,t3_dirwfy,"I know how scary it is, but try talking about your struggles more often.","Scary is an understatement, I know how fucking hard it is to talk about this stuff with people who aren't like the two closest people to you, and even with them it's often hard. 

I always hid my anxiety from anyone who wasn't too close to not notice it themselves. But several weeks ago, after a string of struggles in my personal life- divorce, death, and break-ups were all involved- my anxiety was at an all time high, and I was calling out of work far too often. My HR guy, who I should mention told me when I took this promotion that if I called out at all under this boss I would be fired immediately, sat me down with said boss. Of course I knew exactly what it was about, and honestly I was ready to add ""get fired"" to my list of recent struggles (albeit one I deserved).

They sat me down and handed me a paper with every one of my call-outs or schedule modifications over the last 6 months- I won't lie, it was bad. I felt ashamed. They told me I'd have been fired weeks ago if I were anyone else. (I am a member of a 3 person specialized department and hard to replace). They said it was especially hard because I'm so great when I'm at work, I just can't make it there consistently. 

They asked if there were any health reasons I was calling out so much. Having not said more than one or two words of agreement to this point, I swallowed the lump in my throat and shakily began. I told them that no, there were not physical health issues involved. I said I had been diagnosed with severe anxiety. And explained the personal situations, which to that point I had also not told anyone at work about. I said that sometimes I am just having a really bad day with anxiety and end up calling out. I didn't get too much into specifics, and I really didn't try to make excuses. I said I understood that everyone has their own issues they are dealing with, but I had just been struggling recently. I apologized for inconveniencing my boss and coworker, and I really meant it. At this point of course I still thought this was me being fired.

They told me that while everyone has their own issues, that was a lot for a young guy to be dealing with at once, especially with an anxiety disorder. They said that what i was dealing with *was* a health issue, and asked if I needed any assistance getting help. I told them I felt I was already doing my best to get better, with therapy and medication. They assured me that they'd rather me stay home if I am having a particularly bad day or episode, and we can always work around it- switch that day for a day i was going to have off, etc. 

I was crying the whole time, embarrassingly. But unfortunately it just happens when I talk about the nitty gritty parts of this stuff. And by the end it was half tears of bewilderment that their response had been... understanding and support? For someone that rarely shares this stuff, and thought that it often goes poorly if you do, this really blew me away. I have never felt more supported, and since the meeting, my call outs have dropped mostly back to regular levels- turned out my anxiety over the looming issue didn't help either. And from the company's perspective- they fixed the issue from their side while making a young employee much more loyal to them long-term. It was a total win/win.

If anyone has bothered to read this far, my point is- be honest about your struggles more often. You might be surprised at the response. You also might not be, but then you're just back where you started. But not having to hide these things is such a liberating feeling, and being accepted is amazing.",Anxiety

1657,t3_dj2wyd,How do I stop obsessing over my partner's mortality?,"I want to summarize this as much as possible to save you from reading an essay.

I have bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety which welcomes a lot of intrusive thoughts. My childhood (like many others) was *rough* to say the least. Certain events led to the development of my deep, and irrational fear of being abandoned. That being said, my boyfriend, now fiance of 11 years has been absolutely endearing and supportive.

I have terrible separation anxiety from him, and constantly think about the possibility of him dying, whether it be from some kind of cancer, sudden cardiac arrest, falling from somewhere high, choking on food, murder, heavy objects falling on him, a coworker planning something against him, a car accident, you name it. It's fucking morbid... I thought of every possible way to his demise. This makes me overbearing and protective. I'm constantly checking in on him while he's at work, or when I'm in a lecture. He said it doesn't bother him, and even told me he fears the same, which is why he likes to be in constant contact with me, but I feel that my anxiety is a lot more aggressive than his.

He just started his second job (grave yard shift) and it's making my anxiety sky-rocket. He works at the airport, and I'm scared there will be a bomb, coworkers with ill-intent (this is a trend. I seem to have deep distrust toward people surrounding him), or get into a traumatic accident. At this job, he can't always check in with me like at his other one. It's giving me shortness of breath because I don't know if he's okay or not, and my level anxiety is not pretty right now. It's destroying me to the point where I contemplate calling his supervisor to make sure he's alive and well.

I'm not religious, but often pray to God that if he plans on taking my fiance, to just take me instead because I don't want to live after experiencing his death. How do widows move on with life? I wonder this a lot... I guess some people truly are stronger than others.

Him working at his second job is giving me crippling anxiety. I also can't sleep without him, so I stay up finishing my homework or studying, however, it's extremely difficult when all I can obsess over is his safety, and whether he's okay or not.

1667,t3_dj2ax4,Everyday i feel so unreal and i cant even sleep because i think ill die if i do,"For almost a month now ive been feeling like im not quite real, like everything around me isnt real and the things im looking at arnt quite there yet everything around me looks normal and ok i just FEEL like its not right. Im scared of sleeping too because of a constant chest tightness and and other weird sensations that i cant convince myself to ignore no matter what. Ive had this feeling of unrealness for a while on and off the last couple years but never have i had it last longer than a day or two and so im starting to worry that maybe im suffering some sort of brain condition.

I know the chances for me to have a brain problem are low (im only 16 and the only people in my family to develop brain problems are elderly women which lowers my risk and i have no diagnosed congenital difficulties) and the chances to even get a brain issue is just as rare or rarer while the chances that ive developed anxiety are more likely to occur especially at my age but i cant get it out of my head that there is something wrong with my brain. Or if its not my brain its my heart, especially my heart as number one fear, because i get short of breath with tight chest all the time even though i had an EKG 3 months ago that said came back as my heart being really healthy but i just cant get it out of my head that im in extreme danger always. 

I cant even get tired without being worried that its being caused by a severe ilness that will kill me, ive been sleeping from 6 am to 4 pm everyday, missing out on everything because im exhausted, i dont know how to stop this and im so tired of this happening. I have some questions for anyone who reads this if you could please answer back that would probably help me out right now

\-I never had any mental issues before but after moving away for the first time, about a month after actually, i now have extremely bad anxiety that is hindering my life, is it normal for anxiety disorders to arise suddenly (i am a 16 year old male if that helps)?

\-What are your symptoms of anxiety? If i hear other peoples experiences it usually helps me stay calm

\-For those who have trouble sleeping, how do you get through it?

\-Could i truly be suffering from a heart problem or brain problem that i am unaware of? should i get checked in your opinions?

\-And finally how do you convince yourself its all okay and nothing is wrong, ive been trying so hard and i just cant do it no matter how much i try?

Basically after struggling with (what I now found out to be) PTSD and anxiety for the past 5+ years, I finally took the decision to visit a psychologist/therapist. Last night, we finished our third session and he recommended that I visit a psychiatrist in order to get a prescription for anti-anxiety medication. 
I was always very skeptical on the idea of medication (and still am), so I'm not too sure what the best choice would be for me. I know that it's the next step forward but I'm very scared about the side effect, especially the weight gain aspect. I'm 21F and have finally reached a point in my life where I'm comfortable with my weight and don't want to put myself in a situation of hating my body again.

It's the only job I could think of where I could work alone. It's also my first job and I'm glad I got the opportunity to do it.

That said, I'm constantly having to deal with equipment breaking and being scolded each day for missing stuff. Even parts that just take way too long to do in my allotted time. I called my boss asking if I could drop my second shift because it's been a disaster. I'm constantly anxious about it and recently some family troubles have come up requiring me to be around in that time. I keep rushing and missing things at work because of that. I can barely focus on the job, and my heart literally hurts from the anxiety. My manager laughed when I told her I wanted to drop the shift and she didn't seem to realize I just literally couldn't do it. 

So today I just didn't show up to my second shift. I tried to tell her but she said she was in a rush and just hung up before I could. So I just sat in the bathroom at my first shift crying. I haven't cried in so long. Tomorrow will be so bad. I won't be able to sleep at all tonight. If I don't get fired I still just want to quit because the stress is horrific right now and the timing of the shift I just can't do, but she doesn't seem to understand. But I'm terrified of quitting. I'm lucky to be able to quit because I do live at home but it feels so terrible. It's going to be so awkward tomorrow, so hard, and it's all I can think about is going in, being scolded, and me choked up trying to tell her I'm quitting. She's quite a cold woman and it's hard for me to deal with. What's more I'm a tall bearded man but such an anxious mess that I get choked up and literally can't speak when I'm anxious. I'm absolutely petrified but I just can't do it. I can't give two weeks notice. I just need it all to be over. I have a test tomorrow first thing in the morning, the time when I usually finally fall asleep. I don't know what to do. Terrified of the phone calls I know I'll be getting. I just can't handle this and don't know what to do. I know I'm in the wrong for quitting like this but I have a random family situation that's come up but I don't know how to explain it to her, even though I tried earlier she just kind of brushed it off and expected me to go to my second shift but I couldn't.

i've watched dozens of videos, read countless articles, because i want to make sure i'm taking good care of her. i get so nervous when i don't see where she is. i watch her tail obsessively to try and assess if she's in a good mood. but most of all, i'm so worried i'm not disciplining her correctly while she's a kitten that she's going to grow up a nightmare cat and i'll feel like a failure when my mother and i start to resent her for it. but if i rehome her now, when i haven't even given myself a chance, i'll feel equally a failure. will this feeling go away? do i just need to stick it out? 

are there for sure things i can do to reassure i'm doing a good job? i spent an hour today using cardboard and duct-tape to board up various gaps in the kitchen and it soothed over the concern she'd squeeze behind the appliances.

1677,t3_diwb82,Health related panic attacks - please share what has worked for you,"TLDR; I feel hopeless about these attacks. What has and hasn’t worked for you?

I’ve had anxiety since I was young- more specifically panic attacks. It was always around vomiting. I used to be terrified - I would try to control my situations and always have an exit plan. 

About two years ago, on a terrible vacation - it changed to death. Now I panic that my throat will close and I’ll suffocate or that my heart is palpating and it’s going to stop beating. I need to check my pulse. I feel the urgent need to leave and go to the hospital. I’ll work myself up more and more into a full blown panic. 

I’ve only gone to the hospital once for a panic attack - I’ve tried at all costs to not let into the urge to go there. I feel it will be a major loss - I don’t want to make that behaviour “normal”. 

I feel the intrusive and catastrophic thoughts a few times a week. Sometimes it escalated to panic - not always. 

It feels so hopeless in the moment- that I’m certain I will die. When I try to rationalize with myself - I start to think “if you think this is hard just wait until your older and have real heath problems or your family gets sick - then you’ll really have something to be sad about”. 

I find this health anxiety so difficult - it’s not like vomiting where I could tell myself “worst case you vomit” ... for this one —- what—-“worse case..I die?” It’s hard to accept. 

I’m on meds. I did some CBT a year ago and didn’t see much improvement so I stopped.

I've had pretty bad anxiety for a little while now (undiagnosed because my parents are military so they have the ""suck it up mentality""). It's gotten worse as I've grown up and right now I think it's at its worst:

-I pick at my skin on my upper arms and they're all scarred over
-I pick at my nail beds until the hangnail is gone (it never is) (usually ends up as a bloody mess) 
-I zone out for a good amount of time, just sitting at running through scenarios of how I could fuck up/ why i shouldn't ask for help from my teachers/friends

Anyways, the reason it's gotten so bad is because I've recently moved to a new school in a really really small town, which naturally is very different than my old school that was in the city. This isnt the issue though, the issue is that my teachers HATE me drawing in class and drawing is my main coping mechanism that keeps my mind off the bad stuff.

 So now I've been left with the picking and everyday I leave school with bloody fingers. So much that I've even started to accept that it's a real problem. I'm struggling in my classes (chem specifically) because I'm to scared to ask my teacher for help since theres only like 7 people in that class, so theyd all see I dont get it, that would make me feel so stupid (I have friends I hold on a pedestal in that class so that just adds to it) 

I want to ask my mom to take me to counseling, maybe see if there is anything a professional can do to help me,  whether it be medication or therapy, I don't know, I just want to feel better 

The point of this post was to.. vent a little I guess? But also I was hoping to get some other people ideas on how I should ask my mom?

1694,t3_dj0kj4,I'm not sure what to call this!,"Hi everyone. I've tried writing this post a few times and it always ends up too long, so I'll try and be brief.

For my entire life, I've always felt sort of anxious about everything, all the way up until I was in my early 20's. It was never enough to bother me, but I always felt out of place or unwelcome or like I didn't understand the rules about the world everyone else seemed to inherently know. I was too nervous to make eye contact with the lady behind the register at the grocery store - it wasn't debilitating anxiety, but it definitely was something!

I joined the Marine Corps two years ago, and I've loved every second of it. I got my butt handed to me in boot camp by Drill Instructors, who were leaders and mentors that saw what I was capable of and wouldn't accept anything less than my best. It was a very transformative experience for me, and after those three months of training, I feel like I'm in control of my life more than I was before. I'm less anxious, more confident, and I love talking to people! Gaining a little bit of healthy weight sure helped too - I feel confident in my body; a feeling I'd never had before. I did some time with the Marine Corps and I'm now currently in the Reserves and attending a university.

But there's one lingering issue from before my service - I can't bring myself to go out and try new things. It's very strange, and I can't put my finger on a reason why! I've made big decisions before - enlisting with the military definitely was a huge decision! But small decisions or small leaps-of-faith are so difficult in a way that I can't exactly describe.

At the grocery store, I consider grabbing some new ingredients and spices and experimenting, or learning a new meal to cook... and then I buy my normal stuff and leave.

On a boring day I consider driving to the local rock-climbing gym and testing my skills and maybe meeting some new people... and then I sit inside all day and do nothing.

It seems like outside of my little piece of the world, between my local gym and my classrooms in college and the library, I can't bring myself to do new things or meet new people! I'm in my early 20's and I don't enjoy how averse I am to going out and having new experiences. I don't think I've done anything aside from my usual college routine for the last year.

I'm wondering if anyone has any words of wisdom or a direction to point me in so that I can research my issue and make a plan for how to combat it. The only professionals I have access to in my area are school counselors - I visited one, and after I told her my grades were high she told me I didn't need her. (It seems like her job is to make sure I get out with good grades, which isn't my issue!)

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some help.

No, I'm not choosing to have anxiety.  And my circumstance may not be that bad, but right now, I'm anxious and cannot help my emotions.

It's gotten to the point where I can't remember doing things. I'm a musician, and after I get off stage, sometimes I literally can't remember performing. I have to question whether or not something actually happened, or if I just thought that it happened. An example: sometimes I have to hand in forms, and I'll be convinced that I filled out the form, when in reality I didn't. My memory is so jumbled at the moment, I can't even begin to distinguish reality from not. Whenever I try to ground myself, I get extremely anxious and sometimes I have a panic attack. People apparently call out my name, and I rarely respond. I also often go through these short periods where I just stare off into space, not processing anything at all. When I get out of these weird states, I can't remember them happening until about an hour or less later. Sometimes I also find evidence of me doing things that I don't remember doing, such as poetry, and evidence that I've self-harmed, like cuts on my arm. Why is this happening to me",Anxiety
1701,t3_dizoru,DAE have poor affect display?,"*Affect displays are the verbal and non-verbal displays of emotion. These displays can be through facial expressions, gestures and body language, volume and tone of voice, laughing, crying, etc.*

I always have trouble expressing my emotions in a physical form, e.g. in my facial expressions. I might be perfectly content and happy, and someone will stop me to ask why I'm angry, or why I'm sad. I say that I'm not, and then they mention that I'm frowning, or I look like I'm about to cry.

It goes the same for when I'm actually upset or angry. I'll mention something to a friend like, ""oh I wasn't doing well yesterday, that's why xyz"", and they'll be like, ""really? I couldn't tell. You looked fine to me.""

I've also had my family get mad at me for ""taking things too seriously"" after I've made a sarcastic joke. When I say that I was being sarcastic, they fire back with, ""no you weren't, you were being passive-aggressive, I can see it on your face"". I get frustrated when this happens, so I end up actually being angry because they told me that I was angry when I wasn't.

I've always just learned to say, ""that's just the way I look"", or ""I have RBF"". I have dealt with this for years and I'm thinking it must have to do with my anxiety (which I have also had for years, coincidentally). I was sort of made to bottle up my feelings as a child because I had a hard time restraining my emotions. I was easily angered and excitable, very reactive to insults or jokes. Now I think it's messed up my expressions.

I don't have trouble feeling emotion. In fact, I would say that I feel emotion more than regular people thanks to the anxiety and depression. But my facial expressions and body language don't match how I'm actually feeling. I thought for a while that maybe I had mild autism, but I've done tests with psychologists before and I've had maybe one trait, but never enough for an official diagnosis.

Have been on medication for anxiety for about 6 years now. 

Had been on a consistent dose of Venlafaxine for 5 of those and coping extremely well, stable, confident, happy.

Just before last Christmas, hit with a WALL. Anxiety levels I haven’t felt since before medication. Had forgotten how intense and bad it could feel. Saw my doctor and increased my dosage. Felt better for a few weeks, then worse again. Saw my doctor, repeat. This cycle has gone on in the months since to the point where I’m now at max dosage of Venlafaxine AND a second medication, Wellbutrin. 

What is happening to me. I don’t understand why it would change so suddenly and so drastically. I’m also now seeing a therapist.

He told me he really cares about me but needs to see improvement since it's not fair to him. Which of course I agree to.

panic attacks, trichotillomania

First off, I don’t have any kind of anxiety diagnosis and realise I need to see a doctor in order to get one - this post isn’t asking for a diagnosis but rather advice and support on how to approach my gp. Some stories as to if/how seeking help worked for you would be appreciated. 

I am also Scottish and have tried accessing therapy through the nhs website with no success, most recommended apps are also unavailable to me and therapists nearby are costly. I also believe at this time medication would be of more benefit to me and am under the impression anything that works must be prescribed to me not over-the-counter

I’m writing this after having another huge panic attack which has left me convinced I’ll make a doctors appointment, however I don’t trust myself to follow through in the morning so I’m posting in hope that responses will bring me to my senses.

I’ve had symptoms of anxiety since around age 11, where I suffered from constant hair pulling, leaving my hair patchy - this was a result of bullying in school which also led to stomach aches, migraines, and panic attacks. Long absences have been a trend in school and work for me ever since.

When I approached my doctor about this with my mother my anxiety symptoms were said to be effects of bullying and the stomachache was said to be period pains and puberty.

Since then, I have continued to experience symptoms of anxiety in worsening degrees, I think the lack of a real diagnosis or counselling put a bad taste in my mouth around doctors regarding mental health and I really doubt myself and feel like going would be a waste of a doctors valuable time. 

When I got my first job I left after 8 months and haven’t worked a real job since. I quit due to panic attacks every morning and stomach pains and in some cases diarrhoea and sickness on busier more stressful days. Around the time I left my work (which was around Christmas time, I left without even giving notice due to the severity of my fear; I feel awful about this.) I had a night similar to tonight where I promised myself I’d seek help, but nonetheless I didn’t follow through.

I’m currently at university and going through the process of starting work experience. An invitation for a phone interview brought on a massive panic attack, and although I have a stomachache, tightness in my chest, sweaty hands and feet, and feel like I’m full of adrenaline every day, this spike in anxiety around work will definitely hold me back as it did before and isn’t something I can work around without quitting and hiding like I’ve done in the past.

* How am I going to cope when my mom / my husband (not even married yet) / my sister passes away
* How am I going to cope with aging
* What if I am alone when I am older, what if my kids abandon me (don't have any kids yet)
* What if I get sick and am not able to live a full life.

I had a panic attack three weeks ago that was a consequence of therapy and delving deep into trauma. We decided to take a step back after that because we realized I am alone in this city and don't have a strong support system. 

The anxiety right now is leaving me feeling a bit hopeless. Reddit and social media can be a double edged sword where I see thing that trigger these thoughts and make me thing what if that happens to me. For example I saw a post of suicidal ideation and that just triggered so many what if thoughts about what if I get so depressed and I get to that point. 

I know really these thoughts are manifesting from: 

* Homesickness, feeling lonely in the city I am currently in. Many times all I want is someone to just lay down with me and be there while we are doing our own things. My best friend from back home has been a saviour in she facetimes me everynight until I fall asleep. I try to get my roommate to sleep with me cause we are close but she is really busy and goes to sleep much later than me and wakes up much earlier. My other friend here is just really busy and he comes over sometimes, I bus with him so that is nice but I wish he would come over more. 
* Getting to the end of my degree, thinking about what I am going to do next. I know I am going to take a break after I finish my degree but after that I don't know what I want to do with my life - maybe policy analysis cause that is what I want to do now. I know I want to have a full life, have things to do on Halloween and thanksgiving, meet with friends and travel. That is what is keeping me going. 
* Trauma from when I was younger making me fear that I will never get into a good relationship. I have body and trust issues which I now I need to overcome but will probably work on when I am back home and have a better support system.

1716,t3_dik2u5,Does anyone else ever feel like a fraud because your anxiety is different to how anxiety is usually portrayed in media etc?,"I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder in February this year, I was put on Lexapro and I’ve been seeing a psychologist every six weeks. She think I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was a child, but I still have moments where I worry that I don’t actually have anxiety, because mine is so different to others experiences that I have heard about or seen in media. 

First of all I don’t have any social anxiety, which I feel is probably the most well known kind. I love socialising, meeting new people doesn’t faze me and I actually feel better when I am with other people and out and about. I love public speaking and it doesn’t scare me at all. This makes me feel like a fraud, because it’s so easy, surely I don’t have anxiety? If that makes sense?

Secondly, my anxiety is mainly focused on a few things: death (myself or my children dying), throwing up (emetophobia), and then a few other random phobias like flying, life like mannequins, confined spaces and bugs etc. These fears weigh on me considerably, but I feel like they are all so random, and not issues that you usually hear about in people with anxiety.  

I also don’t doubt myself daily, as in I don’t second guess all of my decisions, and I don’t hate myself or have low self worth. I feel like I hear about these in particular from friends who have anxiety all the time, and it’s just not an used or me. 

This is silly, but you know how there are lots of memes out there about what it’s like to have anxiety? I feel like I don’t relate to any of them. It really makes me doubt everything, like what if my psych is wrong? But she is the professional so I should trust her.

On top of that, I feel like I've been thrown back into being a teenager again being judged by these girls who just innately know how to be feminine and look fierce in a way I just never will. 

Every single time I get a hair cut, I come out with something conservative a stylist bullied me into because (I can only assume) she doesn't think I can carry off what I actually want. Like today I even asked directly and threw ideas back and forth with her and she still essentially just gave me a trim because she doesn't think what I want will look good.

I got the treatment but managed to escape without the products. I don't know.

Anyway, I am taking 20mg escitalopram and it helps a lot, but it's just not enough. All doctors seem to want to do is stack SSRIs, and it almost seems like I'm not being taken seriously enough.

What treatments have worked your severe GAD and/or social anxiety? What else should I consider trying? I am at a complete loss at this point. I don't think I will ever be a functional adult and it makes me want to give up.

Before it is suggested, CBT and other therapies aren't an option due to unemployment/insurance. For now, i need to look at medication options to get me to a place where I can finally explore therapy treatments.

TLDR: 20mg escitalopram (Lexapro) not cutting it for very debilitating GAD/social anxiety. Therapy not an option. Curious about additional medications to explore to supplement the Lexapro. Don't want to just keep stacking SSRIs and crossing my fingers. Looking for advice.

1728,t3_dinsow,Anti-anxiety medication,"I'm 27, male, and I'm suffering from depression and anxiety for most of my life, and it really harms my life. I'm seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, and I'm treating my depression with Wellbutrin (Bupropion) 300 mg for the last 2 years after a not so good 1.5 year experience with Cipralex (Escitalopram), first 10 mg, then 20 mg - mainly because I felt it really numbed my emotions, shut down my sexual drive and didn't mesh so well for the ritalin I'm taking.

My anxiety is ever-present, and it's grounds me everytime I want to do something, be it clean my room, go to the supermarket, dare to talk to some customer service representative, study for school or advertising my business. Every day I'm having internal battles with myself, because doing anything scares the living lights out of me, and it's exhausting.

I'm sure most of you relate on some way or another, and some of you also have some experience with anti-anxiety medications. I'd be happy if you could share your experiences, be them positive, negative or both, how did it affect your life, and how did it mesh with other meds you were taking (mostly Ritalin and Bupropion).

So I got off SSRIs about a year ago, and first 3 months was hard but I got a lot of my feelings back and stuff. I had weird symptoms and such... but I still had emotions and sexuality. During this time and the months following I had extreme anxiety, DPDR, and stress due to the withdrawal basically. I also had a lot of moments where I had extreme panic attacks beyond comprehension. After each of these panic attacks I would get way more numb (happened like 4 times). Anyway, is it possible the stress of withdrawal burnt out my nervous system completely?

I basically lost feelings, got anhedonia, sexual anhedonia, lack of sensation in genitals AND skin... feel kind of ""numb"" all over my body, yet I do not feel anxiety really.

When I feel anxious or dissociated I dont really feel that anxiety feeling, like the panic and stuff.. i just feel really uncomfortable and I don't know whats going on until im like, oh its panic/anxiety... 

I feel fatigued but it is like a mental barrier, when I push past it I kind of am fine, yet still sorta fatigued but its not like a real fatigue... feels different.

I also lost my inhibition and social anxiety, I used to be very socially anxious and stuff... now I can say whatever i want I dont even care.

1735,t3_dipfje,5 pitfalls to avoid when recovering from anxiety,"Hey folks,I struggled with anxiety and panic attacks years ago.  I managed to fully recover and since, have been helping many others fully recover full time.  I wrote an article for my private Facebook group about the 5 pitfalls and figured, this would be helpful to others.  The people in my group are people who are focused on fully overcoming anxiety once and for all.  Hope you enjoy the post:

**Avoid these common pitfalls**

Recovering from anxiety is tricky, yet simple at the same time. While individuals who are struggling with anxiety think that their behaviors are harmless and benign, it is in fact, not just unproductive, but causing them to dig themselves into a deeper hole in the cycle.

I see this too often.

I was able to eventually avoid these pitfalls myself. I was very lucky, yes. However, I wasted a ton of time and energy making these same mistakes below.

If you see yourself doing ANY of these things…it’s important to take a serious look, and re-evaluate your plan of attack for recovering with anxiety.

**1. You’re on forums too much (yes that includes this one also):**

The internet in general provides a rich soil for misinformation to take hold to the unsuspecting observer. Too much conflicting information, woo-woo, loony toon theories, scare-mongering, and quacks with good intentions give you bad advice or uninformed guidance. It’s easy to abandon the right method and try to copy-paste someone else’s mildly-successful attempt at recovering. I call this *the shiny object syndrome* — and it plagues many anxiety sufferers. The truth is this. Recovery doesn’t lie behind a computer/phone screen.  It doesn’t come from watching a YouTube video, Facebook/reddit thread, or a google search. Recovery comes while living life. If you’re on forums too much, anxiety is too big a part of your life…and you need to minimize as soon as possible In fact, everyone who becomes my client eliminate all interactions or engagement on forums

.**2.  You’re still looking for tips for anxiety and panic attacks:**

I get this question all the time. “Hey, do you have any tips for recovering?” Listen very closely — tips don’t work. And if you think about it, tips are just a sophisticated way of making you stop feeling your feelings…which is the opposite of what you should be doing. It also plays into the narrative that lack of your recovery has been caused because you have been “missing the secret” or don’t know the “hidden quick fix cure.” To be honest, addressing the anxiety is not the hardest part of recovery…its breaking the bad habits that keeps anxiety alive. And tips don’t fix that. In fact, just *telling* people what to do is not enough. Think of losing weight and getting fit. It comes down to eating less and working out more. But we all know it’s not as easy as that, it takes guidance, structure, education, and patience…anxiety is no different.

**3. You are still trying to figure out the “root cause”:**

Whether you’re trying to figure out why you have excess adrenaline, why you’re still having brain fog, why your dp/dr is so strong, or what caused your first panic attack…the solution doesn’t require a root cause. This is a common impulse I see. Out of all the sufferers I’ve met (and I’ve met a lot), literally 99.9% of them didn’t need to figure out the root cause in order to recover. I get it, you may have had trauma. I understand…many people in this group have had trauma, many have not. “But my trauma is unique and intense.” Sure, but recognize trauma can be anything. Even getting lost as a child in a grocery store is traumatic. If you’re one of the .01% who has had trauma that needs to get addressed, address it fast and focus on recovery at the same time. Otherwise you’re just using your trauma as an excuse to convince yourself you are unique. Which brings me to my next point.

**4.  You have convinced yourself you are unique and unable to recover:**

This is partly anxiety’s fault. It has a great way of making you think you are unique and alone. Are there other people that have recovered? Sure…but you think you can’t.  Why?Because your symptoms are the worst ? Or you’ve had them the longest? Or you have another problem that stops you from recovery? Right? Does this sound like the internal dialogue in your mind? How would I know this? Because I not only thought this, but I have also heard this from *literally* every other client.  But I get it. Convincing yourself you are unique is understandable…but if you’ve been in this group for a while, you should know by now that you aren’t. On a subtle level, recognizing you’re not unique is a hit to your ego. This is because you’ve been struggling for so long, it’s easier to think there is an inherent flaw with you. When I was struggling, I was wishing there was something physically wrong, because I didn’t want the stigma of having anxiety. I’m so blessed it was just anxiety and nothing serious. Let go of the thought that you’re unique.

**5.  You’re unwilling to invest in getting this fixed:**

“WHAT?!?! Of course I am! I’ve bought essential oils, lavender, CBD, supplements, meditation, yoga, accupuncture, and tried meds but it didn’t work.” Initially while struggling, many of us spent a small fortune on getting anxiety fixed. We’d go online, search whatever fixes this, and buy the product from whichever company that “claim” to cure you; but when it doesn’t, you become disheartened and stop. We begin to realize the world is a cruel and money-hungry place that is willing to do anything to take money from the desperate . In the beginning, we all spent a small fortune... this is understandable…but once you learn that true recovery come from within, if you are still buying things like these -- you’re not someone serious about recovery, you’re a dabbler. And you can’t dabble into recovery. It takes work, focus, patience, and guidance.

Did I miss something? Probably… but these are the top 5 that come to me right away, and I thought this post was getting too long for it’s own good.

If you are someone dedicated to recovering and need some additional help, I'll post a link to the fb group in the comment below.  There are article, podcasts, videos specifically focused on helping you recover.

I have to constantly move my neck left, right, up and down every 5 minutes to relieve the tension.

On top of the neck pain I also have lots of clicking noises in my neck that sound flat out abnormal and are constant. 

I had an x-Ray recently and it showed my neck was fine. I might try get a MRI to rule out a “physical” cause, but at this stage my GP probably thinks I’m crazy. 

Could this pain be anxiety related? I was genuinely sure it was arthritis or some severe disc degeneration...

On top of that I also have these physical symptoms: 

- Acid reflux (makes me choke)
- Excessive saliva (makes it difficult to speak and makes my lips peel)
- vibrations and tremors in thighs
- Back pain
- Jaw clicking and pain

1739,t3_diveoo,So I got a promotion today but my bad feeling are making it hard to be happy about it.,"Long story short: I will work as a team leader for two month during christmas season in the warehouse I have been a regular employee for two years now. Starting at the end of october.  
I prepared for it really well and applied for the job.  
I am SO FUCKING HAPPY that I got the job and my self esteem got a nice push from this today.  


But also there is that annoying feeling that I made a fool of myself today because I was so happy during that feedback interview that I was kinda nervous and just smiled weirdly and asked dumb questions. At least I feel like I did.  
Also there is that fright that I will end up embarassing myself when I am working in that position and regret it.

I am 23 and will be younger than all the others team leaders (I think none of them is under 30) and also much much younger than a lot of the regular workers that I will then have to give instructions to.

Also I already know that some of the other employees will hate seeing me in that position (I don't give a fuck honestly lol but I am afraid that they will try to make this bad for me).  


I really think I can do this, I am clever enough and I now my stuff and also I get along with all the other team leaders but I am afraid that my social anxiety and lack of experience will ruin this for me.

Recently however I’ve started university, and am doing an overseas semester in Athens, which has been really great. It affirmed a lot of things for me: my trust in myself, my independence, and my belief that I had a handle on anxiety. Until issues with financial aid started.

I come from a low class family, and without getting into details, the process for me to get financial aid has been so painful and difficult. Today I got an email telling me I needed to pay for everything by November 1st. I’m in touch with advisors and have contacted everyone I could, taken all the steps I’m able to. I know I’ve done my part.

But the waiting. God, it’s just the waiting that absolutely kills me. I had a full blown panic attack in the shower just thinking about getting kicked out of school. It makes my stomach do flips, and that heart-wrenching feeling begins. 

Right now all my friends are getting ready to go out for the night, and I just want to lay in bed and cry. It’s especially hard because I’m far from family, from familiarity, from a support system I’ve spent years building. I just didn’t expect the anxiety about finances to be so bad.

1751,t3_ditzpi,Help from those who've read The Untethered Soul.,"Hello, I've been really into mindfulness lately, from daily meditation to therapy to reading books and it's helped so much in understanding my anxiety.

So once I got my hands on The Untethered Soul after reading so many good reviews I was very excited. But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the voice in my head that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to say that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I think of literally anything, i think oh this is not me, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry is that also not by my choice? Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?

Hopefully you understand my dilemma I'm in. I really want to continue and read the whole book but it seems everytime I try to understand the who ""voice"" thing my anxiety starts to raise and I get confused.

-Skinny (Not a surprise seeing how I’m only a teenager)

“It’ll be fine, they’ll know you’re a guy because of you’re clothes.” I was wrong.

Every single time I go outside there’s always at least one or two people staring at me.

On a few occasions I would hear them talking about me when they think I’m not paying attention, or am not listening.

Most cases whenever I would walk pass someone, most of the time they would turn their heads towards me whenever we crossed paths.

The whole thing is sort of super-charging my anxiety, and it feels as though I’m being eaten from the inside out. I could cut my hair of course, but I’m super used to having long hair and would not like to go back using hair products (Pomade, Wax, etc.) to make it look good.

I guess I’m just asking for support on my side. Because I feel as though people never consider how I feel whenever they make comments about me whenever I’m in public.

So in the last few months I have noticed that I have this feeling of dread for no reason at all. I have always felt a looming dread but it was occasionally or for a specific reason like upcoming exams. However, recently it has increased significant and multiple times a day. For example, I would being playing Sonic and all of a sudden I would be feel it hit me. I would carry on with the game hoping it would go away. Sadly it doesn't and eventually I will stop what I am doing because this feeling takes away the enjoyment. I also want to cry when i get this feeling and my heart seems to get faster. This feeling seems to be more in my heart and gut than my head if you know what I mean.

My life has not really changed apart from two things. The first is that I am in the process of applying for university though I am not necessarily worried about this since I have good grades. The second is that I have started going to the gym and dirty bulking (clean bulking was way to hard and costly) to increase fat and muscle. I have been following my routine pretty consistently and have seen good progress. My calories have increased by double in about 3 months. Could this be the cause?

I also believe I have a some depression (probably for a good 2 years) likely caused by family issues or genetics (my mum has it) which I have heard can lead to anxiety although if I have depression why has my anxiety gone through the roof in the last month. The depression has gotten a bit better recently too and I am not on any sort of meds a part from my eczema cream.

But the idea of sitting there trying to think of what to say puts knots in my stomach. We’re planning to spend 1 day driving to each relative and visit for a bit before moving on to the next one. I’m literally trying to do mental math to figure out what is the minimum amount of time I can spend at each person’s house without seeming rude. Oh and my husband and I just got married last year and all of these relatives weren’t able to make it because of distance/cost/health reasons, so I want to show them pictures and videos from the wedding.

I hate being on planes and I really didn't think it was a good idea to go on a trip like this with all my anxiety. My family wanted me to do it for my gap year before college and because they seem to think ""getting out more"" will magically cure me, even though I know it won't. I just didn't have the courage to just say no.

My anxiety is causing me a lot of trouble over this. I keep getting sharp chest pains and worrying about my heart. I keep dissociating and worrying if it will get worse on the trip. I'm also worried I may be getting sick because some of my family are, and getting sick on the trip will make it a lot worse.

1766,t3_disxuj,Has anybody here had EKGs/stress tests?,"Hi reddit, 

For the last couple weeks I've been experiencing intermittent chest pain. I dont have it everyday, but when I do have it, exercise makes it worse. That seemed like a red flag, so I went to my dr. She noticed I have PACs (extra heartbeat) but said it's probably benign and sent me for a stress test/EKG. The cardiologist said the same thing...I have an extra beat pretty often but nothing to worry about, otherwise looks fine. 

Anxiety was suggested. I'm not embarrassed or reluctant to start a regime if that's really what it is, but did anybody else here start thinking they had some kind of heart issue and end up correctly diagnosed with anxiety? 

It has been a very stressful year for me and I had a traumatic childhood (no contact with my parents since I was 19 in 2012) so I wouldnt be surprised. But it seems strange to me that the chest pain happens intermittently, not all day and not every day. I've also noticed I get it when I'm relaxed as well. And there's times I'm stressed out that I DONT have it. 

I'm just very confused, open to all thoughts or comments. I know the answer is ""talk to a dr"" but after my results were normal I've essentially been dismissed. The cardiologist spent approximately 10 seconds with me, and my dr called after that to say 'great news,youre fine'",Anxiety

1770,t3_disqpo,Hypochondria/Cardiophobia,"So I haven't really been open to this to anyone except for my parents that are supportive but I just need more help.  I have really bad hypochondria and cardio phobia.  if you are not to sure what that is will post the definition of each.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Hypochondriac:**  *a person who is abnormally anxious about their health.* 

**Cardio phobia:**  *Cardiophobia is defined as an anxiety disorder of persons characterized by repeated complaints of chest pain, heart palpitations, and other somatic sensations accompanied by fears of having a heart attack and of dying. Persons with cardiophobia focus attention on their heart when experiencing stress and arousal, perceive its function in a phobic manner, and continue to believe that they suffer from an organic heart problem despite repeated negative medical tests. In order to reduce anxiety, they seek continuous reassurance, make excessive use of medical facilities, and avoid activities believed to elicit symptoms. The relationship of cardiophobia to illness phobia, health anxiety, and panic disorder is discussed. An integrative psychobiological model of cardiophobia is presented which includes previous learning conditions relating to experiences of separation and cardiac disease; deficient and inappropriate behavioural repertoires which constitute a psychological vulnerability for cardiophobic problems; negative life events, stressors, and conflicts in the person's present situation that trigger and contribute to the symptoms; current affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms and their stimulus properties; and genetic and acquired biological vulnerability factors. Finally, recommendations for the treatment of cardiophobia are derived from the model and areas of future research are outlined.* 

&amp;#x200B;

So a little back story to when it all started,  I was in the 8th grade in my science class I started getting heart palpitations and about passed out in class,   im not sure what caused this but I would worry that it would happen again.   Everyday I would worry about it so much once I got in my science class that I would make myself have panic attacks and would have to go to the nurses office daily, any other class I was in seemed to be OK just happened in that class because that is when it was first triggered.  Throughout the year it started getting worse and would start noticing myself panicking about it in other classes until finally one day it was all day long.  Few years and here I am,  but now it actually physically hurts me,  like make my chest hurt or my left shoulder heart (cardio phobia) .  After i finally told my parents I felt like a bunch of stress was relieved and it actually cured me for months.  4 months later and here I am going back to how I use to be, physically in pain and worrying about it and not sure what I should do.  Has anyone experienced anything like this before?  If you have what did you do to overcome it?  Even if you don't have an answer just support would be great,  its very tough for me.",Anxiety

Is this normal? I deal with anxiety and depression on and off that I've never gone to see anyone for ever. I don't know if this situation is normal. For my doctor, they would just bill me and I pay it on a payment plan. I get a medical reimbursement from my insurance for paying the rest of bills like this but this place wont let me do that. They want me to pay in full before I see a counselor, or I can't see one. They want a credit card on file at all times for this purpose. It's a reputable place and was recommended by my doctor, but there's been lots of small reasons this place has been a turn off.

But to tell you the truth, I couldnt get past the first few pages without it triggering some anxiety within me. When it started talking about the voice in my head that he believes is what can cause someone's anxiety. And how he says to say something in your head, then goes on to say that is not you. I began thinking ""oh great theres voices in my head"" lol and you may see where this is going lol. So now every time I think of literally anything, i think oh this is not me, and it just spirals from there.

So for those who read the book, can you explain more about this voice the author is referring too. And does he mean literally anytime you think of anything in your head it is not you? 

I understand that negative thoughts and ruminating thoughts are come and go not by your choice, that I've accepted and its helped me alot. But when it comes to actively thinking and saying things ""in your head"". I begin to worry is that also not by my choice? Since that ""voice"" is not me. When I'm doing math homework is it not me that is rattling off these formulas in my head?

I ended up losing it to him and after lots of self loathing I finally accepted that's theres nothing I can do about it but now I think I ended up even more insecure. I suffer from anxiety and intrusive thoughts that come at night about my death and losing loved ones. It makes me feel like I'm messed up and I will be forever damaged. He is still my best friend and without him I'd have no one but I don't think I'll ever be the same and that hurts my soul so much.,Anxiety

1805,t3_dio6lm,I've been having out-of-control panic attacks for the last week that have caused extreme memory loss and are preventing me from doing things I need to do. My next psych appt is on the 31st. Am I justified in going to an urgent care?,"For some background, I'm being weaned off of a high dose of lithium that I've been on for years.  I was discharged from the hospital about three weeks ago and it was a traumatic experience (they're...  known for that...  :/) and they were treating me for Bipolar disorder instead of depression.  My new psych that I've seen twice said that that diagnosis (also made by the same hospital several years ago during my first stay) is incorrect and that I certainly have major depression--hence weaning off of the lithium.

I'm pretty sure that the med change is making things much worse for me than they will be once my meds are straightened out again.  I called my new psych last week and got put on the waiting list for if an appointment slot opens before my pre-scheduled appointment on October 31st.  No luck yet, and these panic attacks are becoming unbearable.  I'm forgetting where I am, who the people around me are, getting lost everywhere I go, having around 30 panic attacks a day (not counting the ones in my sleep), and I just can't follow through with most obligations now because of it.  Everyone who has been around me, even briefly, can tell something is seriously wrong.

I was wondering if there is anything an urgent care can do to help me get through the next two weeks until my appointment with my psychiatrist?  This is mentally and physically exhausting and is shaking up my family.  Not to mention that I'm also supposed to be going to job interviews!!!  My life has come to a screeching halt again.  I just don't want to waste their time if there's nothing they can do.  I'd also really like to avoid being put back into the hospital again (not suicidal or actively self-harming).

1807,t3_dijs11,i feel like the biggest burden,"i recently started confiding in on of my friends about my anxiety and general mental health and i’ve quickly come to rely on him a lot, especially since both of my closer friends are in new relationships and my boyfriend has a lot of homework, so i’ve been really lonely. i was really close with him last year, but we grew apart a bit after i convinced him to go after the girl who he was talking to. i became friends with her, too, after that, but we haven’t talked as much recently.

anyway, this friend i confide in is busy almost all the time between sports and hanging out with his girlfriend. i’m always scared to message him because i don’t want to interrupt anything or be a bother, but i’ve really come to see him as a brother and trust him a lot in the last couple weeks and i enjoy talking to him and helping each other get through life. i get kind of sad when i see him hanging out with his girlfriend even though i love them as a couple and they’re both some of my closest friends because i know it means the person i rely on the most is going to be busy for a few hours and i won’t have anyone to talk to.

it really hurts every time i realize that i am nobody’s number one priority. i put so much emotion and effort into my friendships and relationships but i always end up feeling like a burden for wanting to talk to my friends. i’m at the point where i’ll be in the middle of a sentence and suddenly i feel sick to my stomach just from hearing myself talk. part of me wants to isolate myself as much as possible and let my mental illness take me.",Anxiety

1809,t3_dintxt,Embarrassed myself at work :(," So... I basically cried in front of my manager at work last night.

To preface this, I'd already had a really stressful day at university. I had loads of deadlines and I missed an important feedback session because I got lost and couldn't find the right room (which was also really embarrassing...). Then on my way to work my dad phoned me to tell me he'd had to call an ambulance for my mum that morning and she was in hospital. He told me not to worry and she was okay now, but I turned up to work freaking out.

Because of all this, I was really distracted and off my game at work. I decided to just tell my manager what had happened so he didn't think I was acting weird or being rubbish at my job. I didn't expect to get emotional at all - I hadn't had a chance to tell anyone about what had happened to my mum and I thought I'd also worry less if I got it off my chest - but halfway through my story I was suddenly about to burst into tears.

It was soooo awkward.... He seemed very confused/surprised that I was telling him this and suddenly getting really upset. I was equally as confused/surprised. He started asking me all these questions but I could feel my bottom lip wobbling and knew if I spoke I'd just start crying. There were also still customers around at this point.

I think I recovered pretty quickly and did feel waaaay less stressed after I told him. He was also pretty nice about it and said I could take any phone-calls I needed and offered to make me tea. But I'm so embarrassed that it happened and keep having flashbacks of it. Does anybody have advice on how to move past this?

1811,t3_dinqgy,Anxiety about being a single 30 year old man,"To cut a long story short, my fiancee and I split about 18 months ago. Was the most heartbreaking time of my life and I firmly planted myself in self destruct mode. 

After about two/three months of self destruction I started to see a therapist and work through some of my issues about the relationship and just general anxieties I've had for years. I knew I'd always been plagued by these issues, but I never knew to what extent it had seriously impacted my life. Couple of examples below:

• Prevented me from saying no

• constant people pleasing

• not viewing myself as a proper adult

• attaching myself to relationships all the time because I thought that's what I needed

• I allowed my ex to mentally abuse me, not just her but the one before her as well. Some of the things I've unpacked during therapy have made me see how toxic and abusive the relationship was. I almost feel bad believing this though because I still don't necessarily see those things as toxic/abusive actions, and feel if I mention them to people they'll think I'm so stupid. Anyway, I guess they were because my self esteem and confidence is non-existent.

&amp;#x200B;

I've now had approximately 75 hours of therapy and while I can see quite a big difference in certain areas of my life (trying to be more of an adult, saying no more, communicating better, trying not to people please all the time, sticking to arrangements, not letting my house be unclean, cooking more, walking my dog a lot more, etc etc), my anxiety still feels very, very bad - sometimes I feel anxious all the time. I think it's got a lot to do with the fact that since June (I know that may not seem long, but to me that's quite a thing), I've had very little interest from women. I've not been on any dating sites or anything, but even a bit of flirting or whatever when I'm out hasn't really seemed to occur. As I'm sure you're all aware, someone that suffers with anxiety needs constant approval from people about their self worth. While I'm not actively seeking female companionship at the moment so I can work through my issues, and get to a stage where I don't give a shit about anyones approval, the odd bit of approval and compliments etc give me such a boost. Being 30, I feel like I'm running out of time - irrational I know, but it's the way my mind works. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the time, my ex meant the entire world to me - she was my reason for being, so taking that away had a huge impact on my mental health, and my self esteem. While many confident people would simply look at the end of a relationship as a bump in life's road, I look at it like it's the end of my life - my chance to ever be with someone again has now been and gone, and when I think about being with someone again, I just can't picture it, especially with my current state of anxiety. I'm sure my ex is dating someone, or dating around and that's not my concern - she's entitled to do whatever she wants, but by God this feeling of jealousy that she's doing better than me and this overwhelming fear I have that I'm not wanted is horrible. This idea I have that because I'm single and not dating or even have any women interested makes me less of an adult, a child. Being with my ex made me feel like I was a proper adult. We owned a home, we bought a dog, we were getting married - that's gone now.

Those events are always about when I let myself go too far, where I talked too much, broke down, in completely unreasonable circumstances. I have a lot of basic life stress, and a lot of bad/traumatic events in my life, but I don't let anybody know about that. Now in the couple of events that I did tell people that, and primarily the events where I brought out suicidalness, I can't stop thinking about, and it makes every thing that I talked about that brings me stress even more stressful. They didn't ask for me to say that, they didn't ask for me to break down. Ugh, I just hate this. Like why do I feel even worse, feel like they're constantly judging me now, and thinking I need help. I don't want people to help me, I'm perfectly fine. But now that they know, they're going to want to talk to me, they're going to want to be ""soft"" around me, and try not to ""trigger"" me. Just why did I ever tell them in the first place? I'm completely overthinking, but it seems like so much like a rational overthinking (if that makes any sense). I want people to just be them around me, I don't want people to think about me while I'm around them.

1828,t3_dimj74,I need help to find an ESA,"I've done some research and found that an Emotional Support Animal would be very beneficial to me whether it be a cat or dog (I know there are other animals besides cats and dogs that can be trained to be an ESA, but I've only ever been around cats and dogs, and I've owned more than one cat in the past so I'm more experienced in that area), but I've run into a few problems:

1) I need to be properly diagnosed by a therapist for anxiety and depression, but where I live it can be a huge hassle to go through to even get a therapist and I'm also too socially anxious to talk to people in authority such as a therapist.
1a) This is a problem because according to my research, I need to have an ESA letter written by a therapist which would enable me to have an ESA. I read that I can fill out a form or something if I don't have access to a therapist, but the website didn't say if it was for New Zealand or for America only (but this would be a huge help). 
2) From what I've researched, there isn't a lot of support/help for ESA'S in my country (New Zealand). I found a New Zealand website for therapy dogs which includes emotional support dogs, but there wasn't a dog listed for that specific type of training.
3) I found out about emotional support cats, but I wasn't able to find any information about them at all. Emotional support cats would be more beneficial to me as well, as they're more affordable and easier to take care of and they don't always require a lot of exercise.
4) The cost. My parents are separated, and one side has barely enough money to live in a decent house, and the other is able to pay for what they need and have a bit of money left over but not enough for an animal. If I was to get an animal, whether it be an ESA or not, I would most likely have to help pay with my pocket money. 

If possible, I don't know whether I'd get one now/soon or in the future, but I know that having one would benefit me greatly. I avoid going into stores or crowded places, and sometimes school can get overwhelming. I've never had a panic attack, but I've been in situations where I've frozen out of fear (I don't know if that counts as a panic attack or not...?) and just had high blood pressure because I start to panic or stress in normal environments. It would be helpful to take one to school, but I understand why it wouldn't be allowed (plus I would probably get a lot of people trying to pat the animal, and it may cause a distraction).

1831,t3_dikaon,Anxiety everyday.,"Idk if this is what you would call anxiety. But when I get nervous or feel anxious I throw up and my stomach starts to hurt. Most people’s stomach just hurt and they have to go to the bathroom. 

When I get nervous it’s usually something new in my life. Like new job, starting school, anything new basically. My previous job I would throw up everyday before work and at work before I actually started my job. After a while I quit because I got used to it and the people. 

Fast forward to today, I throw up horribly every morning(just started school, college) and I’ve been throwing up since I was younger, not like this though. I honestly don’t want to even wake up because it’s so bad. I wake up an hour and a half before I have to be at school(I work after school) and I throw up and go to the bathroom for like the first 35-40 minutes. It’s terrible. It’s just because I’m super nervous and whatnot. Before I started school I would throw up only once before work almost every morning. I’m stressed at my job a lot so I’m thinking that’s why.  And the funny thing is, when I am in school after like the first 5-10 minutes, I’m fine. I always say “why was I even throwing up” or whatever. But everyday it’s the same thing. I don’t think it’s a habit either, because I was able to stop previously for a while and it randomly started back up again. 

My family members think I should go to the doctor. I have before recently and they did blood work and asked the usual questions and the blood work came back perfect. The reason I’m also avoiding the doc is because I don’t want them to give me a pill. I don’t want to rely on or be stuck on a pill for the rest of my life. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m having trouble gaining weight because of this issue. I am in shape, but I would like to gain more weight. 

Last thing I’ll add, I cannot tell myself that I won’t throw up. A lot of people tell me it’s in my head etc etc. I can’t tell myself no. Although I do not try to initiate the throw up, I just feel it in my stomach and throat, and I can’t stop it once I get that feeling.

1838,t3_dii01d,Habit of Repeatedly Asking For Assurance,"I struggle with generalized anxiety, and I noticed it cropping up more than it used to. I used to not trust anyone. I've moved to being able to mostly trust people, but inconsistencies really rock me. I tend to really settle in with people at first and let my guard down hard. Everything is fine, it's all good, I don't imagine there ever being a problem. But no one is perfect, and the minute something pops up with that person, I have a hard time just solving the problem and moving on. For hours, days, sometimes weeks, I have a habit of asking over and over again for reassurance that the problem is solved and everything is okay. Imagine a pollster asking the same question 10 different ways to make sure they've closed all of the loopholes. When that happens, you know that something has really rocked me and I'm frazzled. 

It's not an OCD thing, it's me basically trying to make absolutely damn sure that it's safe to let my guard down again before doing so. Does anyone have any helpful coping strategies?",Anxiety

1843,t3_dif372,Online presence-related anxiety?,"Hi guys. This is my (18F) first Reddit post, so be nice! :'')

Ever since I had a string of bad experiences with online communities a couple of years ago, I've really struggled to establish some kind of 'permanent' presence on forums &amp; sites like tumblr. I do not lie about my age, general location, really change my personality, etc., etc. – all I ever change is the name I use. The problems start whenever I put out anything that I consider less than perfect and/or start interacting with a wider community. I always get trapped in the line of thinking that I'm just forcing stuff on people or they're just indulging me as so to not upset me, which just escalates to me really wanting another 'fresh start' and trying to get everything right.

TLDR; I can't use any online outlets for my interests because I'm weirdly obsessed with everything about my presence being 100% interesting and faultless.

1845,t3_di5q70,I can't stop the intrusive thoughts in my head and compulsive guilt trips. Please help.,"A bit of context: I've been suffering with a constant feeling of guilt and anxiety for as long as I can remember. As a kid it was more sporadic it would express itself as anxiety attacks where i'd feel like the worst person in the world for something insignificant I had done in the past (take something home from school that wasn't mine, cheated on a test, said something mean to someone in the playground). I'm 24 now and since I was at least 18 it has been a constant sense of guilt, culpability and anxiety that I cannot shake, not even for a second no matter how much fun I'm having, I never feel at peace with myself.

I often get violent episodes where flashbacks of shameful things I have done in the past rush to my brain and repeat themselves for hours and sometimes days on end. I want this post to focus on the intrusive thoughts I'm having right now rather than the history of my anxiety.

Please help me. It's been 48 hours. I was lying in bed on Sunday morning and a memory flashed in my head out of absolutely nowhere. I remembered a picture in my yearbook where we were at a conference with my class taking a group photo, 7 years ago. There was a serious photo, and a ""fun"" photo. While everyone is making silly faces I turn around and hug my male friend and give him a kiss on the cheek. It looks really inappropriate and it certainly WAS inappropriate. It looks worse than it sounds. Our school principal is standing behind me, and I'm pretty sure the dude I'm hugging had a girlfriend at the time. Now that book is sitting on people's shelves and I'll be remembered as the school slut forever. Why couldn't I just be like the others and make a silly face? Why did I have to behave like that? Why did I think that would be a fun memory to look back on ?

For the past 48 hours I've felt sick to my stomach, hardly eaten, have had a voice constantly telling me ""you're a whore! You're a slut! Everyone knows and that's why you never had meaningful relationships with people in school! That's why no one liked you!"" On repeat. Again and again. I was definitely promiscuous in my final years in school, I didn't notice the pattern at the time but I tended to go after other girls' boyfriends. After being the model child till 15 I snapped one day and started whoring out. I'm so ashamed that now due to a number of other factors as well (several types of horrible anti depressants that killed my libido, a failed long-term relationship I feel responsible for and a series of fucked up experiences with boys) I hate sex. I'm terrified of it. I think I don't deserve it and I don't want it anymore.

I hate myself.

I've reached out to my psychoanalyst, I have an appointment in 2 days. I haven't seen her in a year. My anxiety is constant, I'm never not anxious and I very often get these intrusive thoughts and flashbacks that make me feel so ashamed of myself. It's so bad that even when I'm in the shower or trying to fall asleep I need to put a show on in the back ground so I can concentrate on someone else's voice than the horrid sound of my own voice in my head constantly telling me you're a bad person! you're a slut! you're an embarrassment! people were right not to like you!

I contacted my health worker and called myself names and explained the situation and swore profusely some more and even she couldn't get through to me.

1857,t3_difgai,Dating a man with anxiety,"My boyfriend (29M) is the most caring and wonderful man I have ever come across. However, when his anxiety hits or he gets depressed he can’t seem to get out of his head. 

I feel useless (23F). I know he needs to help himself and I can’t save him but I want to be supportive. I want to be supportive but honestly I’m drained. Drained of being so repetitive or trying to uplift him but it doesn’t seem to work. He’s so mean to himself. His sleep patterns are shit and lately he’s been having a lot of panic attacks. 

I don’t know how to help. 

Lately, all he wants to do is stay in and cuddle which I love but I don’t want to do that every single week. We don’t go on dates but that also has to do with our busy schedule. I try to push him to get out of bed or do something, anything but it’s easier said then done I know. I just don’t want to seem like I’m nagging him. 

He’s constantly asking me if I want to be in this relationship and asks me if I love him probably 10+ times a day. I am someone who is very independent and busy and well all of this feels overwhelming. I reassure him I do love him because well I do. I try to be there whenever he needs me. I remind him of all his great qualities. Yet all of my efforts don’t seem to be helping. I’m trying to help him and support him through the dark days but I’m not sure it’s working. 

Today he texted me and said he doesn’t like who he is in this relationship. It threw me off and I asked him what that meant and well he just doesn’t like showing how bad his anxiety gets and he thinks he’s a burden. He’s constantly telling me how I deserve better and he always wants to push me away. It’s becoming an every day thing of him asking me why I want to be with him. And asking me if I really want to be with him. And I feel shitty saying this but I’m human and it’s exhausting. I love him but I need advice. 

I just want to see him get better. I don’t want to make him change. I just want him to grow and get better. I’m not sure he wants to. Or I’m sure he does but his anxiety really holds him back. 

Because of his anxiety I find myself not being able to talk about my day or my feelings because I have bad days too but I have to keep all of the bad to myself and only show him happy me so that it’s not both of us going through it. 

He has abandonment issues and has never had anyone take care of him and support him though his mental illness. Parents got divorced when he was young and his father was an addict. Mom was all over the place and not there for him.

He’s expressed that it’s hard for him to accept my love because he’s felt unloved for so many years. I don’t think he wants to break up. I just think he’s having a hard time letting me in and allowing someone besides himself see this side of him. He just needs reassurance that I will be patient and that I won’t want to leave.

This isn’t me making any assumptions. He’s communicated all of this with me. He never was good at talking about his feelings since me. I talk a lot and love communication so I have gotten him to do more of it because I know I couldn’t stay if I didn’t know what was on his mind and he’s made the effort to open up and communicate because he knows i would walk away if there was no communication.

Not sure what to do. 

I’d really like some advice from men who have anxiety and are in a relationship. And women who are in a relationship with a man that has anxiety. 
I just want some insight or any advice at all on how I can be of help to my partner and be of help to myself so that I don’t feel so exhausted.

-time felt like it was moving super fast but also super slow

-had basically no thoughts just sort of cloudy traces of thoughts 

-occasionally heard what was being said but mostly it was like a Charlie Brown wa wa wa

-tried to get myself back to reality by pinching/scratching myself but it only worked very temporarily before I sank back into it. 

-I think my eyes were open the whole time bu to can’t remember, I felt like they were closed but I’m unsure

-my hands were shaking and it was hard to write anything

-I only came out of it when I was given I specific thing to do (we ended up doing an activity with refraction gradings)

I eat very healthy, sleep a good amount, have very little life stressors, meditate daily, go to therapy, and exercise regularly. These things all really help manage my symptoms, but everyday that's what I feel like I'm doing: managing. Everyday it's trying to keep everything under control rather than actually living and enjoying my life.

I don't really struggle with depression, but anxiety just keeps coming up. I'm not desparate, I'm just tired. I'm tired of thinking anxiety is my fault and tired of just thinking I need to get things right to just ""get over it"". And I'm so tired of panic attacks and focusing on my anxiety every moment of every day. 

I really think my brain just doesn't work right. I have an overactive amygdala and it's been that way since childhood. And there's nothing wrong with using chemistry to adjust for that. I'm not weak. I've tried so hard. And it's time to realize I have a very real physical illness.

I'm kind of scared because messing with my mind is something I don't want to take lightly. My doctor has been really encouraging and supportive of my choice not to start and reassures me that the most common side effect is no side effects. But, I still hear all these horror stories online.

My doctor wants me to try Zoloft, but I have an appointment tomorrow to potentially discuss Mirtazapine instead. My anxiety primarily manifests as nausea and kills my appetite and sleep. Mirtazapine's two most common side effects are increased appetite and sedation, which would hopefully help.

This post is mainly to vent and get my thoughts out because it's a big decision for me, but I'd also be curious about hearing people's success stories with medication. It would hopefully bring me reassurance.

They cram everyone in the school into that one room, everyone is way too close for comfort, it’s too loud, and the whole time I’m always watching the exits and freaking out because my mind always jumps to the worse conclusions. Usually I’m terrified about there being a school shooting and the whole time I’m just sitting there trying to think of what I’m supposed to do if that were to occur, it also doesn’t help that my school has had tons of bomb threats and shooting threats in the past, none of them were true but all it takes is one threat to turn out to be true.

1891,t3_dii07r,Xanax is the only thing that has truly helped me,"Okay so I've had severe anxiety since I was around 7, then at 12 developed depression alongside it (hormones? due to anxiety? not sure). I am now in my mid-20's, and I have tried numerous antidepressants throughout my life. They have helped the anxiety somewhat, but not the depression, and they make me feel numb. Also I have developed severe anger issues, especially with family, who does love me but I hold a grudge for every little wrongdoing or BIG wrongdoing (like parents constantly fighting) that they have done constantly, and obsess over those thoughts constantly. It used to be a lot worse when I was in my late teens-20's : Family and I were in a super worse position than now and I would cry many nights and not sleep, have constant panic attacks. Every little thing that goes wrong triggers me and still does. I feel so much rage and irritation all the time. I have only done a few physical things (like pushing a family member when I got mad) but nothign to the extreme but I have thought about it constantly. Sometimes (well, more like occassionally) I am ok with them but one little wrong thing makes me unbelievably angry and I can't stop thinking about what they did that make me angry and it's all their fault that I'm this fucked. It is similar with my boyfriend. I have told him I thought about breaking up with him because he says one thing that is ""triggering."" I have not actually done so, when I was in a worse position a couple of years ago I would ask for small ""breaks"" but they only lasted like a day or 2. I remember when he felt sad at me and said that he wanted to go home, and he was sleeping next to me but my heart was racing and I panicked and cried all night and barely slept. As I've gotten old I've gotten triggered by so many ""little""  and what others would consider trivial things but to me they seem like the most awful things ever and it makes me so anxious I want to kill myself and hold grudges and makes my life seem awful. I also have had constant, racing thoughts since I was younger. I was always diagnosed with ""OCD tendencies"" as well as my depression, but honestly I feel like it's just OCD. When I was younger I used to have believe in God and would have to repeat the same phrases in my head in order to not anger God (also my family is not religious, I just did this myself). Now I am atheist but I am still always nervous if I simply SAY something, that something bad will happen to me (like jinxing/karma). This is CONSTANT. Like I am even too afraid to say I will graduate university, because I feel like something will prevent me from graduating if I say that with confidence. This is also because I have lived in a volatile/constantly changing environment for several years.

Anyway, I just weaned off of lexapro and since I weaned off of it anxiety came back full force. I have chronic sinusitis and have been getting a lot of sleepless nights due to stimulant medication to alleviate sinus issues. Last night I took sudafed and had a complete mental breakdown: I was crying all night, my heart was racing, and my racing thoughts would not dissipate. I wasn't able to sleep until 8am (8 hours after I tried sleeping) and I slept for 3 hours. I'm also addicted/obsessed to the internet and it just makes it SO MUCH WORSE.

I have taken klonopin on and off since I was a teen, and it was good at first and it still works but not as well as xanax. I only began taking xanax this year or so. It's been several months until I've taken it until today. The most I have taken it was .5-1.0 mg a day when I had finals last semester. I  try not to take it daily but it's the only thing that can help me sleep. I was first prescribed .5 mg but then moved up to 1.0 mg because the .5 was no longer working as well (dangerous I know). I do not currently have a psychiatrist, and my PCP prescribes me xanax, although he is extremely hesitant to do so (which is understandable). I am scared of getting addicted and getting Alzheimer's from Xanax. But no other medication I have taken has worked as well, and has calmed me down. I'm still a bit anxious, even after taking 1.0 mg tonight, but I don't know what else to do. I will not be able to sleep without it.",Anxiety

***May be a bit gross for some people I apologize in advance!*** I remember that I was reading in a group of 4 after lunch and my bowels began to just activate hard. I remember hearing my heartbeat and profusely sweating along with heavy breathing because the thought of possibly clogging the toilet, taking too long, holding up the line, or people smelling it from outside was so overwhelming.  
I debated with myself until my body couldn't hold it in anymore and before I could decide it was too late. The kids in my group started to make faces of disgust asking around if they smelled anything weird.
That is when it seemed like that was the first time anxiety had impacted me. Fast forward to 8th grade I began to vomit whenever I became anxious. I ended up going to a specialist and they diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder. They wanted to prescribe me medication and counseling but my mom declined and refused. Instead I got over-the-counter heartburn medicine to keep me from vomiting so much. 
Explaining this story to the specialist, she concluded that my anxiety was in fact hereditary.

Me (M26) my SO(gf) (F25) Length of relationship: 4 months

Hey everyone,

Please refer back to the link above if you'd like more context. But for a quick run down of that post - My GF recently admitted that she didn't love me anymore, only to take it all back.

It's been a month since, however I feel different. I'm not sure how to put it into words. The small bits are that I feel scared, a bit doubtful, nervous, and confused.

I am happy that we can confess our love for each other again and she did explain that in that moment she felt completely lost in emotion. I have tried very much to understand her pain and place myself into her shoes. I cant help but feel traumatized from the sudden shock of that event. Now something that has been bugging me recently is that we have been discussing marriage. I agree that a future sounds amazing but I almost felt pressured when she mentioned that she wanted it sooner than later.

I felt an array of emotions, mostly because to me, marriage is this huge event in your life and I personally would like to go in without any doubts at all. I personally want to feel what I think will be an overwhelming need to want to be with that person forever. I just don't feel that way right now. She's stating that she loves me enough to get married now - but I'm just not getting that from her. I did express that to her however it was met with immediate backlash. This reaction consisted of her feeling that I wasn't being logical.

One thing that has made me feel ""odd"" (not really sure how to describe the feeling) is how much she has asked me to change. Without any hesitation, if she wants me to party and socialize more - I do it. If she wants me to accept that she's friends with past lovers - I suck it up and accept it. If she wants me to travel more for her and with her and make more time - I do it. All without hesitation. I asked her why once. Why is it that I'm the only one that has changed? I always thought a relationship was built around either no one changing or both parties compromising. But this has felt more like a demand and supply. I feel genuinely hurt when I think about it. I feel like although I haven't found my identity, I've been molded into someone that's not me.

She's not willing to change for me the way I am for her. I don't want to be without her either. This internal conflict is eating away at me. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, I don't know how to label it all anymore. Or how to move forward. I've tried it all, changing my habits, seeing a therapist (Still seeing), taking medication. There doesn't seem to be anything outside of time as a solution.

I was informed by a close friend, a blunt friend that I tend to do whatever it takes to try and make a relationship work, even if it means I'm causing myself harm. I find a connection and build off of that with my hopes and dreams. All which blinds be to the real negatives of the relationship. My friend informed me that I shouldn't have to feel this way in any relationship. The need to change, feeling as if you're never...good enough. It's not healthy and that there will be someone out there that loves me for me. Just me.

I feel conflicted because I feel that my SO does love me for the little nuisances of my personality and my friend just doesn't understand that. I also do agree with my friend, that love should feel effortless.

At this point I'm ranting and venting but I'm curious to what anyone else has to say. Thank you.

Taking silent treatment as an example. Toxic right? But I don't think it's that uncommon. I haven't personally met someone who has experienced it, but it doesn't feel like something that would be so rare.
But last time I got it was when I was 12, so 3 years ago. But if we take something a bit more common? Picking on one's appearance. Not toxic? But how much is the considered toxic? What about guilt tripping? Manipulation?

1925,t3_diejtw,Crippling presentation anxiety,"This is a personal problem that my family members don't even know about.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined the workforce right after my graduation.

I am now at a place in my career where I need to start giving more presentations in front of handful of people.

However, I have a crippling anxiety when it comes down to presentation.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up, I never really had any issues performing in front of an audience. 

In middle school, I used to do theaters and I performed in front of hundreds of people -- I was totally cool with that.

However, in high school, I had an experience in my English class where while I was reading out loud, I suddenly became breathless and my heart was beating so fast... I could barely speak. I finished my paragraph sounding like a dying toad.

Ever since then, I became terrified of performing in front of people.

In college, I dropped classes that required presentations because of this fear, and I am afraid this will really hold me back in my career development.

&amp;#x200B;

Small talks and conversations are fine, but when there are more than a couple of people staring at me while I speak... I feel like I am going to die because I can't breathe and my heart is about to burst from overworking (talking in front of strangers makes my symptoms worse). 

It's funny because after 10 minutes of experiencing the symptoms, I feel fine...

A lot of people are surprised when they learn about this part of me because they tell me I am so well-spoken.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to tackle this problem.

1928,t3_di4xm5,I can't control being easily irritated and I can't stop overthinking.,"I have Asperger's syndrome along with anxiety disorder for a good number of years. I have been fighting for years to get the appropriate help and support to ease the stress and tension but sadly the NHS here in the UK doesn't fund for CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and counselling. It is all done through private organizations and are very expensive, especially on the income that I am on.

One example of me being easily annoyed was when I was at the cinema to watch the joker film, one girl was kicking my seat and another guy sat 2 seats down coughing loudly, this was heightening my anxiety and stress levels as I wanted to watch the film with no distractions thus ruining my cinema experience. I always have to wear noise cancelling headphones when I go out in public as I cannot stand loud noises such as screaming kids, people coughing and just noisy people in general. Without this tool, I would not be able to cope through my day to day struggles.

My easily uncontrolled emotions seem to be getting worse due to family and work related issues and I am stuck finding a solution. I even went as far as going to my local MP for help as there was no structure out there for me which is very frustrating and yet his responses are very slow and arrogant (typical politicians). I am so sick of being tossed around to charities that cannot help me with my struggles and yet they are solely focused on their public image. 

I also find that mental health discrimination is completely ignored as I get heavily bullied for my social difficulties and my panic attacks. I once complained to HR about a colleague at work who took the absolute piss outta me saying nasty things laughing 'Ooh he's having a heart attack, quick do cpr haha' and yet they did nothing but give that heartless prick a slap on the wrists. My overthinking is the worst thing out of my anxiety, I cry most nights as I have this feeling that the world is against me and nobody understands my emotional struggles. 

My own mother refuses to accept that I have social difficulties and even called me a 'freak' which is the most hurtful thing I have been called.

I don't know where to start looking for help and I guess thats why I'm here. I don't think I've had a history of anxiety before, although I have had depression in the past.

I've been having issues receiving messages, phone calls, and mail, even for mundane things. 

If I get a text from my mom, I'm afraid to look at it; what if its bad news? What if I forgot I was supposed to visit her today? If I accidentally preview the text, i am then afraid to open the message to respond since I waited so long to respond in the first place; it makes me feel like a terrible daughter.

With mail, I'm scared of bills. I know ignoring them doesnt make them go away but I am so scared of opening mail. Even typing this out was hard. I'm pretty sure I can pay my medical bills, but what if there is something outrageously expensive in there?

The longer I wait, the more I want to ignore it since i feel guilty for ignoring it in the first place. Now throughout my day I feel so stressed at things I'm not getting done for seemingly no reason.

One thing I recently feel like I've gotten in control of is cleaning. Its kept my mind clearer and I feel less stressed when I clean. But i think I may be using that as a way to ignore other things i need to be doing. Even things I enjoy, like art. I told a friend I would do giftart for him and now I'm afraid to grab a pen to draw anything at all, and I'm afraid to talk to him because I'm letting him down.

I guess these are issues that have always been with me, now that I'm writing this out, but it's gotten way worse lately. The only person I do not feel this anxiety with is my boyfriend. He is fully willing to help me, but Im not sure how to enlist his help. If I get him to help me open my mail, isnt that encouraging me to continue ignoring my problems?

I guess I want to know where to start... What are coping mechanisms I can practice? What can I do to feel better?

My first ever car was good for 3 years, then conveniently a few months after I lost my day job it decided to have a fun issue where it would literally cut out while I was driving and wouldn’t restart. That was terrifying in and of itself. Then I ended up spending the $2,000 I had left on my $5,000 credit card in order to get it fixed and my insomnia got worse as I stressed how I was going to pay it all back. I took it to a mechanic and 2 auto electricians but despite them believing they had fixed it, it kept happening. But I just gave up as I was out of money so I sold it to a car wreckers. 

With only my meagre night job I spent 3 years paying off my debt and 1 year rebuilding my emergency savings. All without a car. I was in a reasonably good place mentally and financially when my sister offered to sell me her old car. Even though I was worried it would happen again I jumped on the chance as she took good care of her car and she had just had it serviced and put on new tyres. 

But now all my emergency savings are gone to pay her and insurance, etc and even though I’ve only had it 3 months I’ve already had car problems. I’m just that lucky. The battery died the other week ($215) and recently it’s rumbling a lot while idling and cutting out and of course I’m going to have to take it to a mechanic.

I’m just so stressed about all the money I’ve spent and potentially will spend and Im beyond terrified of it dying on me like my old car. I hate that I regret buying it and I wish I had my money back and I didn’t have this constant financial burden weighing me down.
